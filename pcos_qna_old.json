  "What is Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)?": "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a complex, multifactorial endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age. It is characterized by chronic anovulation or irregular ovulation, excessive androgen levels (hyperandrogenism), and the presence of multiple immature ovarian follicles seen as a 'polycystic' pattern on ultrasound. It often leads to reproductive, metabolic, and psychological complications.",
  
  "What are the main diagnostic criteria for PCOS according to the Rotterdam consensus?": "According to the Rotterdam criteria established in 2003, a diagnosis of PCOS can be made if at least two out of the following three features are present: 1) oligo-ovulation or anovulation, 2) clinical or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism (such as hirsutism or elevated testosterone), and 3) polycystic ovaries as seen on ultrasound with 20 or more follicles per ovary or ovarian volume greater than 10 mL. Other conditions like thyroid disorders must be ruled out.",
  
  "How prevalent is PCOS among women of reproductive age?": "The prevalence of PCOS among women of reproductive age varies depending on the diagnostic criteria used but generally ranges from 9% to 18%. It is one of the most common endocrine disorders in this population and is a leading cause of infertility and metabolic dysfunction.",
  
  "What conditions must be excluded before diagnosing PCOS?": "Before confirming a diagnosis of PCOS, clinicians must rule out other medical conditions that can mimic its symptoms. These include thyroid dysfunction (such as hypothyroidism), hyperprolactinemia, non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia, androgen-secreting tumors, and Cushing’s syndrome, all of which can cause irregular menstruation or elevated androgen levels.",
  
  "What role does insulin resistance play in PCOS?": "Insulin resistance is a key feature in many women with PCOS and contributes significantly to its pathophysiology. It leads to compensatory hyperinsulinemia, which stimulates ovarian theca cells to produce excess androgens and reduces the liver's production of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), exacerbating hyperandrogenic symptoms like hirsutism, acne, and anovulation.",
  
  "Which hormone is often elevated in women with PCOS due to increased LH stimulation?": "In PCOS, luteinizing hormone (LH) levels are often disproportionately elevated compared to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which leads to increased stimulation of ovarian theca cells. This results in excessive production of androgens, such as testosterone and androstenedione, contributing to the hyperandrogenic symptoms observed in PCOS.",
  
  "How is hyperandrogenism assessed in PCOS?": "Hyperandrogenism in PCOS can be assessed both clinically and biochemically. Clinical signs include hirsutism, acne, and male-pattern hair loss. Biochemically, it is confirmed through elevated levels of serum androgens like total testosterone, free testosterone, or dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS). Tools like the Ferriman-Gallwey score help quantify hirsutism.",
  
  "How does PCOS affect menstrual cycles?": "PCOS disrupts normal ovulatory cycles, leading to menstrual irregularities such as oligomenorrhea (infrequent menstruation), amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), or dysfunctional uterine bleeding. These abnormalities are caused by chronic anovulation and hormonal imbalances, which impair endometrial shedding and the cyclical pattern of reproductive hormones.",
  
  "How does PCOS influence fertility?": "PCOS is one of the leading causes of female infertility due to its hallmark feature of chronic anovulation. Women with PCOS may have difficulty conceiving because they do not ovulate regularly or at all, which reduces the chances of successful fertilization. Treatment with ovulation induction agents can significantly improve fertility outcomes.",
  
  "How can PCOS impact mental health?": "PCOS significantly affects mental well-being. Women with PCOS are at a higher risk for depression, anxiety, body image issues, and low self-esteem due to symptoms like weight gain, hirsutism, and acne. These psychological burdens often lead to social withdrawal and may worsen quality of life if not adequately addressed.",
  
  "What lifestyle modifications are recommended for managing PCOS?": "Lifestyle modifications are the first-line treatment for PCOS, especially in overweight or obese women. These include adopting a healthy, low-glycemic diet, engaging in regular physical activity (such as 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week), maintaining a healthy sleep schedule, and managing stress through techniques like mindfulness, yoga, or cognitive behavioral therapy.",
  
  "How much weight loss is beneficial for improving PCOS symptoms?": "A modest weight loss of just 5% to 10% of total body weight can significantly improve PCOS symptoms, including restoring regular ovulation, reducing insulin resistance, lowering androgen levels, and improving the chances of conception. It can also help mitigate the risk of metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes.",
  
  "Which medications are commonly prescribed for PCOS management?": "Common medications for managing PCOS include metformin (to improve insulin sensitivity), combined oral contraceptives (to regulate menstrual cycles and reduce androgen symptoms), anti-androgens like spironolactone (to manage hirsutism and acne), and ovulation inducers like letrozole or clomiphene citrate (for women trying to conceive).",
  
  "What is the role of metformin in PCOS treatment?": "Metformin is an insulin sensitizer that improves peripheral glucose uptake and reduces hepatic glucose production. In women with PCOS, metformin helps lower insulin levels, reduce androgen production, improve menstrual regularity, and enhance ovulation. It is often used in combination with lifestyle interventions or fertility treatments.",
  
  "Can yoga and meditation help manage PCOS symptoms?": "Yes, yoga and meditation can play a supportive role in managing PCOS by reducing stress levels, which in turn can help regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Regular practice has been associated with reduced androgen levels, improved menstrual regularity, better mood, and overall improvement in quality of life.",
  
  "What dietary approaches are recommended for PCOS?": "Women with PCOS are advised to follow a low-glycemic index diet that focuses on whole grains, lean proteins, healthy fats, and fiber-rich vegetables and fruits. Avoiding processed sugars, refined carbs, and trans fats is critical. Nutrient-dense diets help regulate insulin and support hormonal balance.",
  
  "How does PCOS increase the risk of type 2 diabetes?": "PCOS significantly increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes due to chronic insulin resistance. Elevated insulin levels impair glucose metabolism, increase fat storage, and contribute to beta-cell dysfunction over time. Women with PCOS are also at higher risk for gestational diabetes during pregnancy.",
  
  "What impact does PCOS have on cardiovascular health?": "PCOS elevates the risk of cardiovascular disease due to a combination of factors such as insulin resistance, dyslipidemia (high triglycerides and low HDL), central obesity, systemic inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. These risks persist even in non-obese women and may begin in adolescence.",
  
  "Is PCOS curable?": "PCOS is not curable but it is highly manageable. Through a combination of lifestyle interventions, medications, and sometimes fertility treatments, women can control symptoms and reduce long-term health risks. Management should be individualized and sustained over the long term.",
  
  "How can ovulation be induced in women with PCOS?": "Ovulation in women with PCOS can be induced using medications like letrozole, which is now the first-line pharmacological option, or clomiphene citrate. In cases of resistance, gonadotropins or laparoscopic ovarian drilling may be considered. Metformin can also be used as an adjunct therapy.",
  
  "What is the effect of PCOS on pregnancy outcomes?": "Women with PCOS have a higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes including miscarriage, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and preterm birth. These risks are linked to hormonal imbalances, insulin resistance, and associated metabolic disorders, necessitating careful prenatal monitoring.",
  
  "Which ultrasound findings support a diagnosis of PCOS?": "A transvaginal ultrasound may show polycystic ovarian morphology, defined by the presence of 20 or more small follicles (2–9 mm in diameter) per ovary or increased ovarian volume (≥10 mL). These findings, when combined with clinical signs, help support a diagnosis of PCOS.",
  
  "Can PCOS symptoms improve without medication?": "Yes, PCOS symptoms can improve through non-pharmacological methods alone. Lifestyle interventions such as weight loss, dietary changes, regular exercise, and stress management can restore menstrual regularity, reduce androgen symptoms, and enhance fertility, especially in mild to moderate cases.",
  
  "Does PCOS persist after menopause?": "While some reproductive symptoms like irregular menstruation resolve after menopause, metabolic risks such as insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease often persist or worsen. Therefore, PCOS is considered a lifelong condition that requires long-term health monitoring.",
  
  "What is the impact of PCOS on adolescent girls?": "In adolescents, PCOS can manifest as irregular periods, acne, hirsutism, and obesity, which can be confused with normal pubertal changes. Early identification is critical to prevent long-term metabolic and reproductive complications. Psychological support is also crucial due to body image concerns and emotional stress.",
  
  "How is hirsutism evaluated in PCOS?": "Hirsutism in PCOS is commonly assessed using the Ferriman-Gallwey scoring system, which evaluates hair growth in androgen-sensitive areas. A score of 8 or more is typically indicative of clinically significant hirsutism. It is often accompanied by elevated androgen levels in PCOS.",
  
  "Is PCOS linked to higher levels of oxidative stress?": "Yes, studies have shown that women with PCOS exhibit elevated levels of oxidative stress markers such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced antioxidant capacity. This contributes to chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, and may play a role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular complications.",
  
  "What is the effect of PCOS on sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)?": "PCOS is associated with decreased production of SHBG in the liver, primarily due to hyperinsulinemia. Lower SHBG levels result in higher circulating free androgens, exacerbating symptoms like hirsutism, acne, and anovulation.",
  
  "What non-pharmacological treatments support PCOS management?": "Effective non-pharmacological treatments for PCOS include sustained weight loss through dietary changes, structured physical activity, sleep hygiene, and stress-reduction techniques. These strategies not only improve symptoms but also lower long-term metabolic and cardiovascular risks.",
  
  "How does stress influence PCOS symptoms?": "Chronic stress affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, leading to increased cortisol levels that may worsen insulin resistance and androgen production in PCOS. Stress can also affect behavior, sleep, and dietary habits, further exacerbating hormonal imbalances and reproductive symptoms."
