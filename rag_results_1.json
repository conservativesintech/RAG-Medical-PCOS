    "question": "What is Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)?",
    "generated_answer": "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a condition characterized by the presence of multiple small, fluid-filled sacs (ovarian cysts) in the ovaries. These cysts can cause irregular menstrual periods, excessive hair growth, acne, and other symptoms. PCOS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that one copy of the PCOS gene is sufficient to cause the condition. Women with PCOS are at a higher risk of developing other health problems, such as heart disease, diabetes, and infertility. The diagnosis of PCOS is based on the presence of at least two of the following symptoms: irregular menstrual periods, excessive hair growth, acne, and ovarian cysts. The diagnosis is confirmed by a combination of physical examination, blood tests, and hormone testing. Treatment for PCOS typically involves lifestyle changes, such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, and weight management. Medications may also be prescribed to manage symptoms such as acne and ovarian cysts. In some cases, surgery may be required to remove excess hair or cysts.",
    "reference_answer": "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a complex, multifactorial endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age. It is characterized by chronic anovulation or irregular ovulation, excessive androgen levels (hyperandrogenism), and the presence of multiple immature ovarian follicles seen as a 'polycystic' pattern on ultrasound. It often leads to reproductive, metabolic, and psychological complications.",

Mahadevaswamy Senior Nursing Tutor, JSS School of Nursing, Mysuru, Karnataka State, India Abstract People of reproductive age are frequently affected with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), a common endocrine disorder with a range of clinical, hormonal, and metabolic features. The goal of this review paper is to give a thorough summary of the clinical presentation, diagnostic criteria, aetiology, epidemiology, and treatment options for PCOS. Between 5% and 20% of women in reproductive age worldwide are estimated to have PCOS. This syndrome is widely known for being complicated, involving both environmental factors and genetic predisposition. Common clinical symptoms include irregular menstruation, hyperandrogenism, and an ultrasound that reveals polycystic ovarian morphology. Although there are other sets of diagnostic criteria, including the National Institutes of Health standards and the Rotterdam criteria, a precise diagnosis is still necessary. Those with PCOS are more likely",

Insulin resistance plays a significant role in the development of PCOS, as it is a key factor in the pathogenesis of the syndrome. Insulin resistance is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including obesity, hormonal imbalances, and lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise. The insulin resistance associated with PCOS can lead to a range of complications, including infertility, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. The passage also discusses the potential mechanisms by which insulin resistance contributes to the development of PCOS, including the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the suppression of glucose uptake, and the impairment of insulin secretion. The passage concludes by highlighting the importance of understanding the role of insulin resistance in PCOS and developing targeted interventions to address this condition.",

Frequent (e.g., every 10 min), prolonged (12–24 h) serial blood sampling studies have revealed that there is a significant increase in the frequency and the amplitude of LH release with normal FSH release in PCOS (36, 37). The increased LH pulse frequency reflects an increase in GnRH release and suggests the presence of a hypothalamic defect in PCOS (13, 37). Other causes of hyperandrogenism, however, can result in similar gonadotropin- secretory changes, such as androgen-secreting neoplasms (38) or adrenal hyperandrogenism resulting from nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency (39).

Based on that notion the researchers of the present study attributed the improvement of menstrual irregularities to the decrease in insulin resistance in the study group; that was evidenced by a significant reduction in the waist circumference at end of the study [26], causing a reduction in hyperinsulinemia, accordingly improving menstrual irregularity. Also, the present study investigated the changes in the number of menstrual cycles over the study period and revealed a significant increase in the study group compared to insignificant changes in the control group. Interestingly the present study results agreed with the findings of Ornstein et al. [27].

Psychological comorbidities of PCOS with overweight/obesity include anxiety, depression, low health-related QoL, sexual dissatisfaction, poor self-esteem and psychological distress [384, 390, 392]. Psychological health also requires consideration when assessing and managing excess weight, especially in PCOS. When assessing weight, related stigma, negative body image and/or low self-esteem should be considered and assessment should be respectful. Consistent with population recommendations, explanations on the purpose, how the information will be used and opportunity for questions and preferences should be provided and permission sought. Implications of results should be explained and support provided as needed. Overall, healthy lifestyle is recommended in all women with PCOS to maintain healthy weight and prevent excess weight gain and lifestyle intervention is recommended to induce weight loss in women with excess weight.

Clinical need for the question Metformin is a low cost, readily available medication that has been extensively used as an insulin sensitiser for over seven decades in DM2 and for several decades in PCOS. Insulin resistance is documented on clamp studies in 75% of lean women and 95% of overweight women [279] and addressing this has underpinned the use of metformin in PCOS. Metformin is currently widely used by women with PCOS, yet there is variability in recommendations across health professional specialties, with endocrinologists familiar with metformin and more likely to prescribe this therapy. Also the efficacy of metformin in terms of improving clinical outcomes remains uncertain. Mild side effects do cause some concern, and metformin use in PCOS is generally off label. Yet metformin",

The optimal dietary strategy as part of lifestyle management in PCOS remains controversial. We reported in a recent systematic review that the controlled clinical literature found no difference in the majority of anthropometric, reproductive, metabolic or psychological outcomes for a range of dietary approaches including higher protein, higher carbohydrate, lower glycaemic index or monounsaturated fat-enriched diets [13].

How can ovulation be induced in women with PCOS?\n\nAnswer: Ovulatory PCOS (79, 80) is a minority of the PCOS population, and has less severe androgenic and metabolic features than anovulatory women with PCOS. It was recognized that there exists little data regarding the long-term maintenance of ovulation in women with PCOS.\n\n2.

It was recognized that there exists little data regarding the long-term maintenance of ovulation in women with PCOS.\n\n3. What is the Task Force's opinion on the diagnosis of PCOS?\n\nAnswer: The Task Force felt strongly that in those women with polycystic ovaries, but no evidence of clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, the diagnosis of PCOS is less certain, regardless of the presence of concomitant ovulatory dysfunction.\n\n4. What is the Task Force's opinion on the long-term maintenance of ovulation in women with PCOS?\n\nAnswer: The Task Force recognized that some patients with PCOS may demonstrate regular ovulation at the time of their evaluation, the so-called \"ovulatory PCOS\" (79, 80). However, it was noted that 289 patients with \"ovulatory PCOS\" constituted a minority of the PCOS population, and had less severe androgenic and metabolic features than anovulatory women with PCOS. It was also recognized that there exists little data regarding the long-term maintenance of ovulation in women with PCOS.\n\n5. What is the Task Force's opinion on the hormone release in females when females do not ovulate due to insufficient number of ovulatory hormones?\n\nAnswer: Because of these ovaries develop small cysts. These cysts then secrete the androgen hormone. PCOS patients have high level of androgen hormone which create complication in menstrual cycle, and other symptoms of PCOS (Altman, 2023). A follicle is a sac in which egg development occurs, ‘PCOS ovary contains large number of follicles, and they are up to 8mm (approx. 0.3) in size.

Clinical need for the questions Polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) was incorporated into the diagnosis of PCOS in 2003 in the Rotterdam criteria, as a common feature associated with clinical and endocrine features of the condition [57]. This introduced arguably milder phenotypes into PCOS with limited data on natural history, prompting calls for phenotype identification and more research [16]. The definition of PCOM in the Rotterdam criteria is 12 or more follicles measuring 2 - 9mm throughout the entire ovary or an ovarian volume ≥ 10cm3. This was based on a single report on sensitivity and specificity in PCOS compared to controls.

Summary of systematic review evidence A systematic review was completed to address the second clinical question on the most effective ultrasound criteria to diagnose PCOS. Fifteen studies of moderate to high risk of bias, reported the diagnostic accuracy of different ovarian morphology parameters to detect PCOS [32, 37, 59-71]. Two of the fifteen studies were in adolescents [64, 71]. The index tests addressed in these studies included various measures and thresholds of ovarian volume and follicle number.

Ultrasound is not required for diagnosis in adults with features of hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction, who already meet PCOS diagnostic criteria. It is recognised that omission of ultrasound does limit full phenotyping. The recommendation to use FNPO as the key diagnostic criteria for PCOM in adults was reconfirmed by the updated evidence review and expert deliberation.

Postmenopausal women with PCOS have abnormal glucose metabolism [122] and higher triglycerides than controls [119]. Other methods to identify PCOS in postmenopausal women have been proposed.

Testosterone free androgen index (FAI), and calculated free testosterone are higher in women with PCOS aged 18–44 years compared to controls [116]. Regarding menstrual cycles, the average age of menopause in PCOS is not known. A two-year delay in the age of menopause has been estimated using AMH levels [117] and PCOS has been independently associated with later menopause [118]. There is no established phenotype for PCOS after menopause. In postmenopausal women, ovulation ceases.

The exact cause of PCOS is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors. Insulin resistance, where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin, is also commonly associated with PCOS. This hormonal imbalance can disrupt the normal functioning of the reproductive system, leading to difficulties with ovulation and fertility (Altomara, 2021).

The presence of hirsutism is a sign of PCOS, and the hormonal levels are used to diagnose the condition.\n\n2. What are the symptoms of hirsutism in PCOS?\n\nAnswer: The symptoms of hirsutism in PCOS include excessive hair growth on the face, chest, and back, as well as body hair. The hair may be thick, coarse, or waxy, and it may be difficult to shave or trim.\n\n3. What are the causes of hirsutism in PCOS?\n\nAnswer: The causes of hirsutism in PCOS are not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to the hormonal imbalance caused by the presence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).\n\n4. What are the diagnostic tests for hirsutism in PCOS?\n\nAnswer: The diagnostic tests for hirsutism in PCOS include a physical examination, blood tests, and hormone tests. Blood tests may include tests for androgen, estrogen, and progesterone levels. Hormone tests may include tests for androgen, estrogen, and progesterone levels.\n\n5. What are the treatment options for hirsutism in PCOS?\n\nAnswer: Treatment options for hirsutism in PCOS may include hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or other medications to manage the hormonal imbalance. Hormone replacement therapy may help reduce the levels of androgen and estrogen, which can help reduce the symptoms of hirsutism. Medications may be used to manage the hormonal imbalance, such as progesterone or estrogen replacement therapy.\n\n6. What are the long-term effects of hirsutism in PCOS?\n\nAnswer: Long-term effects of hirsutism in PCOS may include increased risk of breast cancer, heart disease, and stroke. Hirsutism may also affect a woman's quality of life, including difficulty with daily activities and social interactions.\n\n7. What are the risks of not treating hirsutism in PCOS?\n\nAnswer: Not treating hirsutism in PCOS may lead to further hormonal imbalances, which can worsen the symptoms of the condition. Not treating hirsutism in PCOS may also increase the risk of developing other conditions, such as osteoporosis and depression.\n\n8. What are the benefits of treating hirsutism in PCOS?\n\nAnswer: Treating hirsutism in PCOS may help improve a woman's quality of life, including improved physical appearance, improved self-esteem, and improved relationships with others. Treating hirsutism in PCOS may also help reduce the risk of developing other conditions, such as osteoporosis and depression.",

In summary, studies in which insulin levels have been lowered by a variety of modalities indicate that hyperinsulinemia augments androgen production in PCOS (Fig. 18 ). Moreover, this action appears to be directly mediated by insulin acting through its cognate receptor rather than by spillover occupancy of the IGF-I receptor. Intrinsic abnormalities in steroidogenesis appear to be necessary for this insulin action to be manifested since lowering insulin levels does not affect circulating androgen levels in normal women. Further, in many PCOS women, lowering insulin levels ameliorates but does not abolish hyperandrogenism. B. Possible genetic association of PCOS and insulin resistance 1. Family studies of PCOS.

Research has shown that many chronic diseases cannot be permanently cured; however, their symptoms can be managed, and patients can improve their quality of life through healthy lifestyle changes. PCOS, being a lifelong disorder, can be managed with proper medical care. This includes symptom management through healthy lifestyle changes, cultural practices, and medications (Pal, 2014). Many patients initially try to avoid medications and instead focus on healthy lifestyle changes as the first step in managing PCOS. To improve their lifestyle, PCOS patients are advised to increase daily physical activities, engage in regular moderate exercise, and prevent insulin resistance. An active routine can help maintain a healthy weight and reduce the risk of diabetes. This routine might include a daily 20–30-minute walk after meals (Shahid et",

Stress Linked with Symptoms of PCOS and Societal Response The symptoms of PCOS such as obesity, hirsutism, hair loss, acne, irregular menstrual cycles, and infertility can significantly impact an individual's self-esteem and mental well-being. The societal pressures associated with beauty standards and fertility expectations can intensify these effects. As a result, PCOS patients often face heightened stress due to both the physical manifestations of the condition and the societal stigma and criticism they encounter. The societal expectations related to fertility and body image can further exacerbate feelings of inadequacy and isolation among affected individuals. The pressure to adhere to traditional feminine roles and the stigma surrounding reproductive health issues contribute to the emotional strain experienced by those with PCOS (Benson et al., 2009; Chaudhuri, 2023; Damone et al., 2019).",
