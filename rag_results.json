        "text": "Table 3 depicts the knowledge of study participants regarding PCOS. It was seen that only 43.4% of the women had heard about PCOS and the most common source of their information was doctors (26.6%) followed by the internet (6.28%), teachers (5.6%), and friends (4.7%). Assessment of knowledge for risk factors showed that out of those who had heard of PCOS, a significant proportion of women were aware of the association of obesity (33.5%), unhealthy dietary habits (35%), and genetic predisposition (40.7%) with PCOS. When asked about complications and long-term sequelae of PCOS 40.1% of women said that patients with PCOS can have problems in conception, 34.4% said it PCOS women are at higher risk of pregnancy loss, 28.7% said women with PCOS are prone to develop diabetes, 31.7% said they can have hypertension, 33.5% said it can raise the chances of cardiovascular disease, 35.9% said there could be an association with endometrial carcinoma and 37.1% said it could be related to psychological problems, sleep disturbances, body image disorder, and anxiety in women. Around 37.1% were aware that eating a healthy and balanced diet can be one of the management methods, 41% believed weight reduction could help, and 35.6% said trying ways to reduce stress could be one of the methods to manage the stress and mood-related symptoms in PCOS women. However, 34.1% said only medications can treat the condition and 2.7% believed only surgery can treat PCOS.

It is aimed at providing scientific evidence and well-balanced information on multi-disciplinary approach for the management of PCOS to health care providers in India. METHODOLOGY Systematic review of literature was conducted to provide the best possible evidence base for the GCPR. Existing guidelines, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, key cited articles relating to PCOS were reviewed by a group of doctors and recommendations relevant to Indian scenario were framed. The recommendations were discussed by an expert panel of gynecologists, physicians, ultrasonologists, endocrinologists, dematologists, and pediatricians in a series of meetings. GCPR for each section of the guidelines were discussed and where there was little or no evidence, the panel relied on experience, judgment and consensus to make their recommendations. The current consensus GCPR are developed in accordance to the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) protocol for standardized production of clinical practice guidelines. Recommendations are based on clinical importance (graded as A: strongly recommended, B: suggested, and C: unresolved) coupled by four intuitive levels of evidence (1 = ‘at least one randomized controlled trial (RCT) or meta-analysis of RCTs’, 2 = ‘at least one non-randomized or non-controlled, prospective epidemiological study’, 3 = ‘cross- sectional or observational or surveillance or pilot study’ and 4 = ‘existing guideline or consensus expert opinion on extensive patient experience or review’).[9] RISK FACTORS FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF PCOS Current Evidence: Figure 1: Modified Ferriman-Gallwey hirsutism scoring system Several risk factors are associated with the incidence of PCOS, but not all are causative or predisposing factors for PCOS.

It is aimed at providing scientific evidence and well-balanced information on multi-disciplinary approach for the management of PCOS to health care providers in India. METHODOLOGY Systematic review of literature was conducted to provide the best possible evidence base for the GCPR. Existing guidelines, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, key cited articles relating to PCOS were reviewed by a group of doctors and recommendations relevant to Indian scenario were framed. The recommendations were discussed by an expert panel of gynecologists, physicians, ultrasonologists, endocrinologists, dematologists, and pediatricians in a series of meetings. GCPR for each section of the guidelines were discussed and where there was little or no evidence, the panel relied on experience, judgment and consensus to make their recommendations. The current consensus GCPR are developed in accordance to the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) protocol for standardized production of clinical practice guidelines. Recommendations are based on clinical importance (graded as A: strongly recommended, B: suggested, and C: unresolved) coupled by four intuitive levels of evidence (1 = ‘at least one randomized controlled trial (RCT) or meta-analysis of RCTs’, 2 = ‘at least one non-randomized or non-controlled, prospective epidemiological study’, 3 = ‘cross- sectional or observational or surveillance or pilot study’ and 4 = ‘existing guideline or consensus expert opinion on extensive patient experience or review’).[9] RISK FACTORS FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF PCOS Current Evidence: Figure 1: Modified Ferriman-Gallwey hirsutism scoring system Several risk factors are associated with the incidence of PCOS, but not all are causative or predisposing factors for PCOS. However, Development of IR and dysregulation of lipid metabolism are seen their presentation is indicative of the incidence of PCOS.

It is aimed at providing scientific evidence and well-balanced information on multi-disciplinary approach for the management of PCOS to health care providers in India. METHODOLOGY Systematic review of literature was conducted to provide the best possible evidence base for the GCPR. Existing guidelines, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, key cited articles relating to PCOS were reviewed by a group of doctors and recommendations relevant to Indian scenario were framed. The recommendations were discussed by an expert panel of gynecologists, physicians, ultrasonologists, endocrinologists, dematologists, and pediatricians in a series of meetings. GCPR for each section of the guidelines were discussed and where there was little or no evidence, the panel relied on experience, judgment and consensus to make their recommendations. The current consensus GCPR are developed in accordance to the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) protocol for standardized production of clinical practice guidelines. Recommendations are based on clinical importance (graded as A: strongly recommended, B: suggested, and C: unresolved) coupled by four intuitive levels of evidence (1 = ‘at least one randomized controlled trial (RCT) or meta-analysis of RCTs’, 2 = ‘at least one non-randomized or non-controlled, prospective epidemiological study’, 3 = ‘cross- sectional or observational or surveillance or pilot study’ and 4 = ‘existing guideline or consensus expert opinion on extensive patient experience or review’).[9] RISK FACTORS FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF PCOS Current Evidence: Figure 1: Modified Ferriman-Gallwey hirsutism scoring system Several risk factors are associated with the incidence of PCOS, but not all are causative or predisposing factors for PCOS.

        "text": "AES PCOS Phenotype Task Force Report 8/23/2006 63 The disorder that eventually would be known as the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) was 64 initially described by Stein and Leventhal in 1935 (1). There is little disagreement that PCOS 65 should be considered a syndrome, that is, a collection of signs and features, where no single 66 test is diagnostic. In essence, the whole (or global assessment) is greater than the sum of the 67 individual features. However, establishing a clear, contemporaneous, and evidence-based 68 definition for this syndrome has important clinical and investigational implications. Nonetheless, 69 the definition of PCOS has continued to generate significant controversy (2-4). 70 Clinically, diagnosing a woman as having PCOS implies an increased risk for infertility, 71 dysfunctional bleeding, endometrial carcinoma, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), 72 dyslipidemia, hypertension, and possibly cardiovascular disease (CVD) (5). Furthermore, it has 73 important familial implications, principally, but not exclusively, for her sisters and daughters (6- 74 8). Finally, a diagnosis of PCOS may mandate life-long treatments (e.g. the use of insulin 75 sensitizers) and may negatively affect her ability to access healthcare coverage, principally in 76 capitalistic markets. Consequently, the diagnosis of PCOS should not be assigned lightly, and 77 diagnostic criteria should be based on robust data. 78 A judicious definition of PCOS is also essential to guide current and future research. The 79 inclusion of patients whose definition, characterization, and selection criteria are unclear 80 continues to plague the PCOS scientific literature. This issue is becoming critical as the field 81 moves to the establishment of larger clinical trials, and to studies of the molecular biology and 82 genetic nature of the disorder. In addition, definitions not based on clear-cut evidence have the 83 potential effect of discouraging future and needed research into the nature of the disorder, its 84 breadth and its phenotype. Consequently, a contemporaneous definition based on what is 85 currently known will benefit future investigation in this area. 86 The Androgen Excess Society (AES) is an international organization dedicated to promoting 87 knowledge, and original clinical and basic research, in every aspect of androgen excess 88 disorders, such as the polycystic ovary syndrome, non-classic adrenal hyperplasia, idiopathic 5",

In essence, 117 we allowed PCOS to have a variety of definitions in order to more clearly define common 118 phenotypes or features irrespective of the definition used. 119 The Task Force drafted the initial report, following a consensus process via electronic 120 communication, which was then reviewed and critiqued by the AES Board of Directors. No 121 section was finalized until all members were satisfied with the contents, and minority opinions 122 noted. Statements were not included that were not supported by peer-reviewed evidence. 123 124 2) CURRENT DEFINITIONS OF PCOS 125 Currently, two definitions of PCOS are in widespread use. The first arose from the 126 proceedings of an expert conference sponsored in part by the National Institute of Child Health 127 and Human Disease (NICHD) of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) on April 16-18, 128 1990. During the meeting all participants were surveyed regarding their perception of what 129 features formed part of PCOS, and Drs. Zawadski and Dunaif summarized these findings in the 130 meeting proceedings (9). They concluded that the major criteria for PCOS “should include (in 131 order of importance) : i) hyperandrogenism and/or hyperandrogenemia, ii) oligo-ovulation, [and 132 the] iii) exclusion of other known disorders”. This survey identified PCOS as an androgen 133 excess disorder of exclusion, with an ovarian etiology and/or consequences. 134 Another expert conference was convened in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, May 1-3, 2003 135 sponsored in part by the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) 136 and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) (10, 11). The meeting 137 proceedings recommended that PCOS be defined when at least two of the following three 138 features were present: i) oligo and/or anovulation, ii) clinical and/or biochemical signs of 139 hyperandrogenism, and iii) polycystic ovaries. These criteria also recognize that other androgen 140 excess or related disorders should be excluded prior to assigning the diagnosis of PCOS. 7",

Assessment of knowledge for risk factors showed that out of those who had heard of PCOS, a significant proportion of women were aware of the association of obesity (33.5%), unhealthy dietary habits (35%), and genetic predisposition (40.7%) with PCOS. When asked about complications and long-term sequelae of PCOS 40.1% of women said that patients with PCOS can have problems in conception, 34.4% said it PCOS women are at higher risk of pregnancy loss, 28.7% said women with PCOS are prone to develop diabetes, 31.7% said they can have hypertension, 33.5% said it can raise the chances of cardiovascular disease, 35.9% said there could be an association with endometrial carcinoma and 37.1% said it could be related to psychological problems, sleep disturbances, body image disorder, and anxiety in women. Around 37.1% were aware that eating a healthy and balanced diet can be one of the management methods, 41% believed weight reduction could help, and 35.6% said trying ways to reduce stress could be one of the methods to manage the stress and mood-related symptoms in PCOS women.

Exclusion criteria (for a Explicit criteria used to decide which studies should be excluded from consideration systematic evidence review) as potential sources of evidence. Heterogeneity Describes the variation in, or diversity of, participants, interventions, and measurement of outcomes across a set of studies, or the variation in internal validity of those studies. It can be used specifically, as statistical heterogeneity, to describe the degree of variation in the effect estimates from a set of studies. Also used to indicate the presence of variability among studies beyond the amount expected due solely to the play of chance. The term is used in meta-analyses and systematic reviews when the results or estimates of effects of treatment from separate studies seem to be very different – in terms of the size of treatment effects or even to the extent that some indicate beneficial and others suggest adverse treatment effects. Such results may occur as a result of differences between studies in terms of the patient populations, outcome measures, definition of variables or duration of follow-up. Hormonal profile Cyclical levels of hormones. Hyperandrogenism Clinical hyperandrogenism is characterised by hirsutism, acne and male pattern alopecia. Biochemical hyperandrogenism is characterised by excessive production and/or secretion of androgens. Impaired fasting glucose When fasting morning blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough to diagnose diabetes. Impaired glucose tolerance When glucose levels are above normal during or after an oral glucose tolerance test but are not high enough to diagnose diabetes. Incidence The number of new occurrences of something in a population over a particular period of time, e.g. the number of cases of a disease in a country over one year. Inclusion criteria (for a Explicit criteria used to decide which studies should be considered as potential systematic evidence review) sources of evidence. Infertility (women) Infertility problems in women include failure to ovulate, blockages in the fallopian tubes, and disorders of the uterus, such as fibroids or endometriosis. Interdisciplinary care An interdisciplinary care model is the collaboration between a woman with PCOS and a care team who have shared goals for her total wellbeing. Intervention Any action intended to benefit the patient, for example, drug treatment, surgical procedure, psychological therapy. Insulin resistance (IR) A rise in glucose occurs because the body can’t make enough insulin or the insulin produced is not working properly. Irregular cycles / When the duration of menstrual cycles is > 35 or < 21 days. oligomenorrhea Laparoscopy A medical procedure used to examine the interior of the abdominal or pelvic cavities to diagnose or treat (or both) a number of different diseases and conditions, including female infertility.

        "text": "Adaptation of existing evidence-based guidelines Given the time and resource-intensive nature of guideline development, existing high quality evidence-based guidelines that address the clinical questions and PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) of interest should be sought for adaptation before starting a new one. Apart from the original Australian guideline, to date no international PCOS guideline covering all health aspects related to the syndrome is available. The evidence-based sections of the WHO guideline, supported by this evidence synthesis team is aligned with the scope here, yet is now out of date. The NICE guideline is limited in scope and is not available electronically outside the UK. It too is adapted from the 2011 Australian guideline. Professional society positions statements or clinical practice guidelines are more limited in scope, do not follow AGREE II (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation) process, involve more limited expertise and geographical representation and are often conflicting in recommendations. Here we have updated and expanded the scope and evidence contained in the 2011 Australian guideline and, where appropriate methods have been applied, integrated the WHO guideline. Evidence reviews to answer the clinical questions Evidence reviews were conducted for each clinical question and from the evidence reviews, the GDGs were able to develop guideline recommendations. The evidence reviews for each question can be found in the supplementary Technical report. The links between the body of evidence, the clinical need for the question and the clinical impact of the resulting recommendation(s), including potential changes in usual care and the way care is organised, acceptability, feasibility and resource implications are clearly explained in the accompanying GRADE evidence to decision framework supporting the recommendation. Selection criteria The PICO framework was used by the GDGs to explore the components of each clinical question and finalise the selection criteria for each question. These components were used to include and exclude studies in the evidence review. Details of the selection criteria for each question can be found in the supplementary Technical report. The highest form of evidence, the most current (within 5 years), comprehensive (with the most outcomes relevant to PICO) and high quality systematic review that meets our benchmark criteria (see table 7) and meets the selection criteria, was used to inform a recommendation. Additional systematic reviews that met benchmark and selection criteria were used if it reported additional outcomes relevant to the PICO, that were not addressed in the first, most comprehensive systematic review. Additional randomised controlled trials (RCT(s)) that met the selection criteria and were not included in the systematic reviews were also used. Where a systematic review met the benchmark criteria but did not meet the selection criteria, or synthesised studies that did not meet out selection criteria, the risk of bias appraisals from that systematic review were adopted. Table 7. Benchmark criteria for a systematic review to be included: 1 Must have completed a search in at least Medline and another relevant database; 2 Must have listed key search terms; 3 Must have listed selection criteria; 4 Must have used an appropriate framework to assess risk of bias/quality appraisal; and 5 Where the evidence is sought for an intervention question and a systematic review has included non-RCTs, the analysis must be subgrouped by RCTs to be eligible for inclusion. 130 CONTENTS",

Community and consumer engagement Extensive engagement and formative research on unmet needs of women with PCOS was a key driver for this work. Far-reaching engagement included focus groups and then surveys of over 1500 women with PCOS. We adopted the International Association for Public Participation (IPA), Public Participation Spectrum framework, in which consumer’s capacity to participate was built and enhanced throughout the process. Consumers were engaged in all phases as active contributors within a distributed decision making environment, ensuring that the lived experiences of women with PCOS were prioritised. Consumer representatives were informed about the process of participation and at GDG meetings were present to embed consumer perspectives within the GRADE decision-making process. Consumers were empowered to ensure that all decisions optimised participation in care. Consumer organisations proactively participated in feedback and public consultation processes and have co-designed and will continue to guide and influence the implementation, translation and dissemination program.

        "text": "P value Measure of statistical precision. The probability that an observed difference could have occurred by chance, assuming that there is in fact no underlying difference between the means of the observations. If the probability is less than 1 in 20, the P value is less than 0.05; a result with a P value of less than 0.05 is conventionally considered to be ‘statistically significant’. Randomisation Allocation of participants in a research study to two or more alternative groups using a chance procedure, such as computer-generated random numbers. This approach is used in an attempt to ensure there is an even distribution of participants with different characteristics between groups and thus reduce sources of bias. Randomised controlled trial A comparative study in which participants are randomly allocated to two or more alternative (RCT) groups and followed up to examine differences in outcomes between the groups. Resource implication The likely impact of the recommendation in terms of cost, workforce or other health system resources. Risk of bias Also called methodological quality, it is the degree to which the results of a study are likely to approximate the ‘truth’ for the participants recruited in a study (that is, are the results free of bias?). It refers to the integrity of the design and specifically the extent to which the design and conduct of a study are likely to have prevented bias. More rigorously designed (better quality, low risk of bias) trials are more likely to yield results that are closer to the truth. Relative risk (RR) The ratio of risks in two groups. In intervention studies, it is the ratio of the risk in the intervention group to the risk in the control group. A relative risk (also called risk ratio) of one indicates no difference between comparison groups. For undesirable outcomes, a relative risk that is less than one indicates that the intervention was effective in reducing the risk of that outcome. Screen In this guideline, screen refers to the process of identifying whether the condition exists and is the first step in offering appropriate management Selection criteria Explicit standards used by guideline development groups to decide which studies should be included and excluded from consideration as potential sources of evidence. Stakeholder Those with an interest in the topic. Stakeholders include healthcare professionals, patient/consumer and carer groups, manufacturers and sponsors. Statistical power The ability to demonstrate an association when one exists. Power is related to sample size; the larger the sample size, the greater the power and the lower the risk that a possible association could be missed. Systematic review A review of a clearly formulated question that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select, and critically appraise relevant research, and to collect and analyse data from the studies that are included in the review. Statistical methods (meta-analysis) may or may not be used to analyse and summarise the results of the included studies. Therapy naive A patient who has not been administered prior treatment for the condition. Type 2 diabetes mellitus When the pancreas makes some insulin but it is not produced in the amount your (DM2) body needs and it does not work effectively. Type 2 diabetes results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors and risk is greatly increased when associated with lifestyle factors such as high blood pressure, overweight or obesity, insufficient physical activity, poor diet and the classic ‘apple shape’ body where extra weight is carried around the waist.

In essence, 117 we allowed PCOS to have a variety of definitions in order to more clearly define common 118 phenotypes or features irrespective of the definition used. 119 The Task Force drafted the initial report, following a consensus process via electronic 120 communication, which was then reviewed and critiqued by the AES Board of Directors. No 121 section was finalized until all members were satisfied with the contents, and minority opinions 122 noted. Statements were not included that were not supported by peer-reviewed evidence. 123 124 2) CURRENT DEFINITIONS OF PCOS 125 Currently, two definitions of PCOS are in widespread use. The first arose from the 126 proceedings of an expert conference sponsored in part by the National Institute of Child Health 127 and Human Disease (NICHD) of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) on April 16-18, 128 1990. During the meeting all participants were surveyed regarding their perception of what 129 features formed part of PCOS, and Drs. Zawadski and Dunaif summarized these findings in the 130 meeting proceedings (9). They concluded that the major criteria for PCOS “should include (in 131 order of importance) : i) hyperandrogenism and/or hyperandrogenemia, ii) oligo-ovulation, [and 132 the] iii) exclusion of other known disorders”. This survey identified PCOS as an androgen 133 excess disorder of exclusion, with an ovarian etiology and/or consequences. 134 Another expert conference was convened in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, May 1-3, 2003 135 sponsored in part by the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) 136 and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) (10, 11). The meeting 137 proceedings recommended that PCOS be defined when at least two of the following three 138 features were present: i) oligo and/or anovulation, ii) clinical and/or biochemical signs of 139 hyperandrogenism, and iii) polycystic ovaries. These criteria also recognize that other androgen 140 excess or related disorders should be excluded prior to assigning the diagnosis of PCOS. 7",

The identification of more than 1000 EDC in food, air, water, pesticides, plastics, personal care products, and other consumer goods, raises specific concerns for pregnant women and women with increased susceptibility to metabolic diseases like PCOS (36,171,191,195,196). Endocrine disrupting chemicals may be involved in the pathogenesis of PCOS given their known and potential hormonal and metabolic effects (36,189,197). This includes many of the areas that have been considered in the unified evolutionary model, such as developmental epigenetic programming, microbiome composition and function, metabolic processes such IR, and regulation of body weight. 3.7.1. EDC and DOHaD Many observational studies have demonstrated the presence of EDC in maternal and fetal serum and urine, amniotic fluid, cord blood and breast milk (198–200). Six classes of EDC have been shown to cross the placenta confirming that the fetus is exposed at all stages of development (109,198). Although it is impossible to perform experimental studies in humans, evidence from epidemiological, molecular toxicology and animal studies provide compelling evidence of adverse developmental effects and transgenerational toxicity (171,189,191,201,202). The realisation of the tragic effects of DES in the 1970’s was first example of an in-utero exposure causing serious transgenerational health effects (191). This was followed by increasing interest in identifying the properties of environmental oestrogens (36). Several oestrogenic EDC have been associated with birth outcomes that are thought to be associated with the development of PCOS (189). These include decreased birthweight (perfluoroakyl substances [PFAS], perfluorooctanoic acid) and preterm birth (di-2- ethylhexyl phthalate) (201). Prenatal exposure to androgenic EDC (triclosan, glyphosate, tributyltin, nicotine) is of increasing concern, given the suspected epigenetic role of in- utero androgen exposure in the pathogenesis of PCOS (48,203,204). EDC can act at any stage of the human lifespan, including preconception and prenatally, and are increasingly becoming a priority in PCOS research (205). 3.7.2. EDC and the microbiome As discussed above, the microbiome is increasingly considered to make a significant contribution to many human diseases, including PCOS (40,206). EDC that disrupts the composition or function of the microbiome have been termed “microbiota disrupting chemicals” (207). In turn, any disruption of the microbiome from EDC can impact crucial metabolic and endocrine physiology and homeostasis (36,208). A number of studies have reviewed the effect of EDC in invertebrate and vertebrate species, animal models and humans. These studies have found that BPA, phthalates, artificial sweeteners, heavy metals, fungicies, pesticides and microplastics can all affect the gut microbiome, and have metabolic and obesogenic effects (202,209,210). They have concluded that EDC exert their effects in a variety of species via a range of mechanisms, including modification of",

        "text": "AES PCOS Phenotype Task Force Report 8/23/2006 63 The disorder that eventually would be known as the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) was 64 initially described by Stein and Leventhal in 1935 (1). There is little disagreement that PCOS 65 should be considered a syndrome, that is, a collection of signs and features, where no single 66 test is diagnostic. In essence, the whole (or global assessment) is greater than the sum of the 67 individual features. However, establishing a clear, contemporaneous, and evidence-based 68 definition for this syndrome has important clinical and investigational implications. Nonetheless, 69 the definition of PCOS has continued to generate significant controversy (2-4). 70 Clinically, diagnosing a woman as having PCOS implies an increased risk for infertility, 71 dysfunctional bleeding, endometrial carcinoma, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), 72 dyslipidemia, hypertension, and possibly cardiovascular disease (CVD) (5). Furthermore, it has 73 important familial implications, principally, but not exclusively, for her sisters and daughters (6- 74 8). Finally, a diagnosis of PCOS may mandate life-long treatments (e.g. the use of insulin 75 sensitizers) and may negatively affect her ability to access healthcare coverage, principally in 76 capitalistic markets. Consequently, the diagnosis of PCOS should not be assigned lightly, and 77 diagnostic criteria should be based on robust data. 78 A judicious definition of PCOS is also essential to guide current and future research. The 79 inclusion of patients whose definition, characterization, and selection criteria are unclear 80 continues to plague the PCOS scientific literature. This issue is becoming critical as the field 81 moves to the establishment of larger clinical trials, and to studies of the molecular biology and 82 genetic nature of the disorder. In addition, definitions not based on clear-cut evidence have the 83 potential effect of discouraging future and needed research into the nature of the disorder, its 84 breadth and its phenotype. Consequently, a contemporaneous definition based on what is 85 currently known will benefit future investigation in this area. 86 The Androgen Excess Society (AES) is an international organization dedicated to promoting 87 knowledge, and original clinical and basic research, in every aspect of androgen excess 88 disorders, such as the polycystic ovary syndrome, non-classic adrenal hyperplasia, idiopathic 5",

These factors, and the high prevalence of PCOS, suggest that there could be an evolutionary basis for the syndrome (15,16,39). Evolutionary medicine has changed the paradigm for understanding PCOS, acknowledging many of the contributing lifestyle and environmental factors that facilitate the observed metabolic and clinical features and that are also shared with related metabolic diseases (8). These “mismatch disorders” are estimated to make a significant contribution to chronic disease in developed countries and a growing proportion of disability and death in developing nations (3). According to the Global Burden of Disease Study, the human diet is now the leading risk factor for morbidity and mortality worldwide (3). In keeping with these findings, diet is recognized as one of the major contributors to the growing prevalence of PCOS globally (7,40). Dietary and environmental factors are hypothesized to have an impact on developmental programming of susceptible gene variants in women with PCOS (41–43). Extensive experimental evidence suggests that prenatal androgen exposure may play a role in the pathogenesis of PCOS-like syndromes in animal models (19,44–46). The discovery of naturally-occurring PCOS phenotypes in non-human primates supports a survival advantage of a hyperandrogenic, insulin resistant phenotype with delayed fertility (47). In humans, the origin of excess androgens may be from maternal, fetal or placental sources. In addition, emerging and concerning evidence suggests that EDC may contribute to altered fetal programming and play a role in the pathogenesis of PCOS (41,48). In-utero genomic programming of metabolic and endocrine pathways can increase the susceptibility of offspring to develop PCOS following exposure to specific nutritional and environmental conditions (45). This view of the pathogenesis of PCOS is consistent with the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) model proposed by Neel (49). Postnatal exposure to lifestyle and environmental factors, such as poor-quality diet and EDC, may activate epigenetically programmed pathways that further promote the observed features of PCOS. Dietary and lifestyle interventions have demonstrated that many of the clinical, metabolic and endocrine features of PCOS can be reversed (7,50,51). Lifestyle-induced changes in the gastrointestinal tract microbiome are another significant factor in the aetiology of PCOS (52,53). Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota has been hypothesised to play a role in increased gastrointestinal permeability, initiating chronic inflammation, IR and hyperandrogenism (40). Numerous studies have reported reduced alpha diversity of the microbiome that has been associated with the metabolic, endocrine and clinical features observed in women with PCOS (54,55). The resulting dysbiosis has been shown to be reversible after interventions aimed at improving diet quality or treatment with probiotics or synbiotics (50,51,56–58). A unified evolutionary theory of the pathogenesis of PCOS proposes that ancient genetic polymorphisms that were aligned with the environment of that era, resulted in an adaptive survival advantage in offspring in ancestral populations (14–16,28). When these same genetic variants are exposed to modern lifestyle and environmental influences, maladaptive physiological responses occur. The prior advantages of insulin resistance, hyperandrogenism, enhanced energy storage and reduced fertility in ancestral",

In essence, 117 we allowed PCOS to have a variety of definitions in order to more clearly define common 118 phenotypes or features irrespective of the definition used. 119 The Task Force drafted the initial report, following a consensus process via electronic 120 communication, which was then reviewed and critiqued by the AES Board of Directors. No 121 section was finalized until all members were satisfied with the contents, and minority opinions 122 noted. Statements were not included that were not supported by peer-reviewed evidence. 123 124 2) CURRENT DEFINITIONS OF PCOS 125 Currently, two definitions of PCOS are in widespread use. The first arose from the 126 proceedings of an expert conference sponsored in part by the National Institute of Child Health 127 and Human Disease (NICHD) of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) on April 16-18, 128 1990. During the meeting all participants were surveyed regarding their perception of what 129 features formed part of PCOS, and Drs. Zawadski and Dunaif summarized these findings in the 130 meeting proceedings (9). They concluded that the major criteria for PCOS “should include (in 131 order of importance) : i) hyperandrogenism and/or hyperandrogenemia, ii) oligo-ovulation, [and 132 the] iii) exclusion of other known disorders”. This survey identified PCOS as an androgen 133 excess disorder of exclusion, with an ovarian etiology and/or consequences. 134 Another expert conference was convened in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, May 1-3, 2003 135 sponsored in part by the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) 136 and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) (10, 11). The meeting 137 proceedings recommended that PCOS be defined when at least two of the following three 138 features were present: i) oligo and/or anovulation, ii) clinical and/or biochemical signs of 139 hyperandrogenism, and iii) polycystic ovaries. These criteria also recognize that other androgen 140 excess or related disorders should be excluded prior to assigning the diagnosis of PCOS. 7",

        "text": "1.4 Ultrasound and polycystic ovarian morphology When is ultrasound indicated to diagnose PCOS? What are the most effective ultrasound criteria to diagnose PCOS? Clinical need for the questions Polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) was incorporated into the diagnosis of PCOS in 2003 in the Rotterdam criteria, as a common feature associated with clinical and endocrine features of the condition [57]. This introduced arguably milder phenotypes into PCOS with limited data on natural history, prompting calls for phenotype identification and more research [16]. The definition of PCOM in the Rotterdam criteria is 12 or more follicles measuring 2 - 9mm throughout the entire ovary or an ovarian volume ≥ 10cm3. This was based on a single report on sensitivity and specificity in PCOS compared to controls. Factors that mandate revision of this diagnostic criteria include inadequate initial evidence, advances in ultrasound technology with greater resolution, variable operator skill level, lack of standard reporting, ill-defined cut-offs between normal ovaries and PCOM, the impact of approach (e.g. transvaginal), body habits and age. Natural changes occur in antral follicle count during the pubertal and menopausal transitions and up to 70% of adolescents have PCOM on original criteria [58]. The term “cystic” is a misnomer referring to arrested follicles (not cysts) and identification of PCOM alone can lead to over diagnosis. Diagnosis of PCOS mandates not only PCOM, but associated features of hyperandrogenism and/or ovulatory dysfunction. Independent of diagnosis, if clinically indicated, ultrasound is useful to screen for other pathology. This clinical question was prioritised, with recognition that a reproducible technique and standard reporting to reliably estimate follicle number per ovary and define PCOM, is critical in the accurate diagnosis of PCOS. Summary of systematic review evidence A systematic review was completed to address the second clinical question on the most effective ultrasound criteria to diagnose PCOS. Fifteen studies of moderate to high risk of bias, reported the diagnostic accuracy of different ovarian morphology parameters to detect PCOS [32, 37, 59-71]. Two of the fifteen studies were in adolescents [64, 71]. The index tests addressed in these studies included various measures and thresholds of ovarian volume and follicle number. None of the studies pre-specified thresholds. Some studies have reported diagnostic accuracy data using multiple thresholds. Due to the heterogeneity in threshold/cut off values for each index test, meta-analyses (for pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates) could not be performed. However, forest plots were created and imputation of sensitivity and specificity data performed to derive true and false positives and true and false negatives to provide greater detail on accuracy outlined in the technical report. This approach enabled a rigorous evaluation of available evidence, acknowledging the overall poor quality of the studies. For follicle number per ovary (FNPO) there were 11 studies with 2961 adult participants suggesting optimal sensitivity and specificity at > 19 per ovary. Other key challenges with the literature in this area included the variable populations (with and without women with PCOS) used to define cut off values and the use of the 95th percentile cut offs to define abnormality. For ovarian volume, 12 studies with 2096 participants showed significant heterogeneity with a lack of clarity on the optimal size with both 5 - 8cm3 and 9 - 10cm3 emerging. There is insufficient evidence to suggest use of other ultrasound parameters including ovarian area; maximum number follicles in a single sonographic plane (FSSP); peripheral distribution of ovarian follicles; bright ovarian stroma; combination of age, follicle number, log ovarian volume, and testosterone; or combination of follicular size and ovarian volume for diagnosis of PCOS. 42 CONTENTS",

        "text": "AES PCOS Phenotype Task Force Report 8/23/2006 63 The disorder that eventually would be known as the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) was 64 initially described by Stein and Leventhal in 1935 (1). There is little disagreement that PCOS 65 should be considered a syndrome, that is, a collection of signs and features, where no single 66 test is diagnostic. In essence, the whole (or global assessment) is greater than the sum of the 67 individual features. However, establishing a clear, contemporaneous, and evidence-based 68 definition for this syndrome has important clinical and investigational implications. Nonetheless, 69 the definition of PCOS has continued to generate significant controversy (2-4). 70 Clinically, diagnosing a woman as having PCOS implies an increased risk for infertility, 71 dysfunctional bleeding, endometrial carcinoma, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), 72 dyslipidemia, hypertension, and possibly cardiovascular disease (CVD) (5). Furthermore, it has 73 important familial implications, principally, but not exclusively, for her sisters and daughters (6- 74 8). Finally, a diagnosis of PCOS may mandate life-long treatments (e.g. the use of insulin 75 sensitizers) and may negatively affect her ability to access healthcare coverage, principally in 76 capitalistic markets. Consequently, the diagnosis of PCOS should not be assigned lightly, and 77 diagnostic criteria should be based on robust data. 78 A judicious definition of PCOS is also essential to guide current and future research. The 79 inclusion of patients whose definition, characterization, and selection criteria are unclear 80 continues to plague the PCOS scientific literature. This issue is becoming critical as the field 81 moves to the establishment of larger clinical trials, and to studies of the molecular biology and 82 genetic nature of the disorder. In addition, definitions not based on clear-cut evidence have the 83 potential effect of discouraging future and needed research into the nature of the disorder, its 84 breadth and its phenotype. Consequently, a contemporaneous definition based on what is 85 currently known will benefit future investigation in this area. 86 The Androgen Excess Society (AES) is an international organization dedicated to promoting 87 knowledge, and original clinical and basic research, in every aspect of androgen excess 88 disorders, such as the polycystic ovary syndrome, non-classic adrenal hyperplasia, idiopathic 5",

        "text": "4.4 Metformin Is metformin alone, or in combination, effective for management of hormonal and clinical PCOS features and weight in adolescents and adults with PCOS? Clinical need for the question Metformin is a low cost, readily available medication that has been extensively used as an insulin sensitiser for over seven decades in DM2 and for several decades in PCOS. Insulin resistance is documented on clamp studies in 75% of lean women and 95% of overweight women [279] and addressing this has underpinned the use of metformin in PCOS. Metformin is currently widely used by women with PCOS, yet there is variability in recommendations across health professional specialties, with endocrinologists familiar with metformin and more likely to prescribe this therapy. Also the efficacy of metformin in terms of improving clinical outcomes remains uncertain. Mild side effects do cause some concern, and metformin use in PCOS is generally off label. Yet metformin is a low cost, readily available medication and off label use in PCOS is allowed in many countries. A multitude of studies have been completed in PCOS for a range of clinical outcomes and synthesis of the literature and recommendations on metformin use was prioritised. Summary of systematic review evidence Metformin versus placebo Twenty RCTs that address outcomes for this comparison were identified [318, 319, 418-435], of which 19 RCTs were in adults [318, 418-435], and 1 was in adolescents [319]. Weight: When 5 RCTs were combined in meta-analysis, there was no statistically significant difference between metformin and placebo [418, 424, 427, 433, 434]. When three of the studies in those with BMI > 25kg/m2 were subgrouped [424, 427, 433], metformin was better than placebo. BMI: When 15 RCTs were combined in meta-analysis [318, 319, 418-422, 424, 425, 428-432, 435], and when 11 of the RCTs in those with BMI > 25kg/m2 was subgrouped [318, 319, 419-422, 424, 425, 429, 432, 435], metformin was better than placebo. WHR: When 8 RCTs were combined in meta-analysis, there was no statistically significant difference between metformin and placebo (p=0.06 in favour of metformin) [418, 419, 421, 424, 427, 429, 431, 434]. When 3 of the RCTs in those with BMI < 25kg/m2 were subgrouped [418, 429, 431], metformin was better than placebo. Hirsutism: When 6 RCTs were combined in meta-analysis, there was no statistically significant difference between metformin and placebo, regardless of BMI subgroups [319, 423, 425, 429-431]. SHBG: When 13 RCTs were combined in meta-analysis there was no statistically significant difference between metformin and placebo, regardless of BMI subgroups [318, 319, 418-421, 423-425, 428, 430, 431, 434]. In one very small RCT (n=20), where BMI was not reported, there was a statistically significant difference in favour of metformin [423]. FAI: When 6 RCTs were combined in meta-analysis there was no statistically significant difference between metformin and placebo, regardless of BMI subgroups [318, 319, 423, 424, 430, 431]. Testosterone: When 15 RCTs were combined in meta-analysis metformin was better than placebo, however there was no statistically significant difference for any of the BMI subgroups [318, 319, 418-421, 423-425, 428, 430, 431, 433-435]. Fasting insulin: When 9 RCTs were combined in meta-analysis there was no statistically significant difference between metformin and placebo [318, 419-421, 424, 425, 429, 433, 434]. In one small RCT (n=60) of those with BMI <or> 25kg/m2, there was a statistically significant difference in favour of metformin [434].

As expected, the 346 incidence of metabolic dysfunction in PCOS is also significantly increased by the concomitant 347 presence of obesity). However, the Task Force recognized that clinical features may not be 348 constant even in a single patient and can be modified by changes in body weight and lifestyle 349 choices, and age. In addition, the Task Force also recognized that there may be a number of 350 women who have features suggestive of PCOS, but who do not fulfill the criteria; clearly these 351 women and their symptoms should be treated accordingly, regardless of whether a diagnosis of 352 PCOS is established or not. 353 A principal conclusion of this report is that PCOS should be firstly considered a disorder of 354 androgen excess or hyperandrogenism. The absence of clinical or biochemical 355 hyperandrogenism in the untreated state, or in women under the age of 40 years, makes a 356 diagnosis of PCOS less certain, regardless of the presence of ovulatory or menstrual 357 dysfunction or the presence of polycystic ovaries. Overall, at the present time in the Task 358 Force’s assessment, women with oligo-amenorrhea and polycystic-appearing ovaries on 359 ultrasonography but no evidence of hyperandrogenism do not have PCOS. 360 The Writing Committee also acknowledged that some of its members considered the 361 possibility that there are forms of PCOS without overt evidence of hyperandrogenism, but 362 recognized that more data are required before validating this supposition. Alternatively, the 363 diagnosis of PCOS in women who have evidence of hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries, 364 in the presence of ovulatory cycles, appears justified based on current data. Finally, while the 365 aim of this report was to yield criteria based on currently available data to guide research and 366 clinical diagnosis, and future investigations, the Task Force recognized that the definition of this 367 syndrome will evolve over time to incorporate new research findings. 368 369 16",

        "text": "1.7 Menopause life-stage What is the post-menopausal phenotype of PCOS and how elevated should androgens be to indicate PCOS? Clinical need for the question Menopause is a natural life stage occurring generally around the age of 51 years. The diagnosis of PCOS by Rotterdam criteria requires two of three criteria in women, including oligo- and/or anovulation, clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries by ultrasound [57]. However, these three criteria for diagnosis change naturally with age impacting on phenotype and presenting challenges in diagnosis. Overall it is acknowledged that there is inadequate evidence of the natural history of PCOS and the concept of whether PCOS resolves and/ or persists remains unclear pending better longitudinal studies. Postmenopausal phenotypes of PCOS are poorly defined, with limited longitudinal natural history studies. Uncertainty in assessment and diagnosis at this life stage leads to confusion for health professionals and women on long term health risks and screening recommendations. Summary of narrative review evidence A systematic review was not conducted to answer this question, which was reviewed narratively based on clinical expertise. With aging, changes occur in all three diagnostic criteria. Menstrual cycles become more regular in PCOS [110-112]. Ovarian volume and follicle number decrease longitudinally in PCOS and control women. Using cross-sectional data, ovarian volume and follicle number decrease in both groups, but the decrease in ovarian volume is less pronounced in women with PCOS than in controls. Age-based criteria to define PCOM have been proposed using a combination of age, log ovarian volume, follicle number, and testosterone to distinguish PCOS from non-PCOS [60]. Androgens decline with age in women generally including those with PCOS [113-115] in longitudinal and cross-sectional studies [116]. Testosterone free androgen index (FAI), and calculated free testosterone are higher in women with PCOS aged 18–44 years compared to controls [116]. Regarding menstrual cycles, the average age of menopause in PCOS is not known. A two-year delay in the age of menopause has been estimated using AMH levels [117] and PCOS has been independently associated with later menopause [118]. There is no established phenotype for PCOS after menopause. In postmenopausal women, ovulation ceases. Hirsutism is greater in PCOS than in controls in postmenopausal women [119] but little is known about acne and alopecia in these women. Postmenopausal women with PCOS have higher 17-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, DHEAS, total Testosterone and FAI than women without PCOS [116, 119, 120]. However, androgen assays are unreliable in women especially with the lower levels generally observed postmenopause [121]. Postmenopausal women with PCOS have abnormal glucose metabolism [122] and higher triglycerides than controls [119]. Other methods to identify PCOS in postmenopausal women have been proposed. For PCOS diagnosis in menopause, previous history of oligo-ovulation, PCOM and current features of hyperandrogenism [123, 124] have been considered, as have insulin resistance [125]. Recommendations 1.7.1 CCR Postmenopausal persistence of PCOS could be considered likely with continuing evidence of hyperandrogenism. 1.7.2 CCR A diagnosis of PCOS postmenopause could be considered if there is a past diagnosis of PCOS, a long-term history of irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism and/or PCOM, during the reproductive years. 1.7.3 CPP Postmenopausal women presenting with new-onset, severe or worsening hyperandrogenism including hirsutism, require further investigation to rule out androgen-secreting tumours and ovarian hyperthecosis. Justification A consensus recommendation was made around assessment of persistence of PCOS in those with a past diagnosis of PCOS or the relevant diagnostic features, or in women with persistent hyperandrogenism. The importance of excluding other diagnoses in cases of significant hyperandrogenism was recognised. These recommendations align with past guidelines with a key emphasis placed on research to provide clarity on postmenopausal PCOS phenotypes and persistence of PCOS postmenopause. Undesirable effects are unclear and it is important to note that reliance on history may overestimate the presence of oligo/amenorrhoea. Labelling of patients with a diagnosis may also have adverse consequences (psychological etc), whilst making a diagnosis may prompt risk recognition and screening such as for glycaemic abnormalities.

        "text": "3.5 Obesity and weight assessment Are women with PCOS at increased risk of obesity? In women with PCOS, does obesity impact on prevalence and severity of hormonal and clinical features? Clinical need for the questions Obesity affects the majority of women recruited from clinic populations and is common in community-based studies. The complex pathophysiology and clinical heterogeneity of PCOS has contributed to the lack of a clear understanding of interactions between PCOS, excess body weight and body fat distribution. Obesity, particularly central obesity, increases insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism, may increase PCOS prevalence and exacerbates the clinical features of PCOS. It is also of significant concern to women with PCOS and a key target for prevention and management in this condition. The degree of increased risk of excess weight and the impact on prevalence and severity of features of PCOS remain unclear. Summary of narrative review evidence A systematic review was not conducted to answer these questions, which were reviewed narratively based on clinical expertise. This review informs both the recommendations for assessment and screening in chapter 1 and the recommendations in chapter 3. In terms of prevalence of excess weight in PCOS, the great majority of women seeking treatment for PCOS are overweight or obese [384]. Rates of weight gain appear higher in PCOS, and BMI increases of one, are associated with a 9% higher prevalence of PCOS [315]. Women with PCOS also appear to have higher genetic susceptibility to obesity [385]. The temporal trends of obesity prevalence in PCOS show an increase from 51% in the 90s to 74% in the following decades [386]. There is general recognition that women with PCOS who present for diagnosis and care may be more likely to have excess weight than those who do not, however longitudinal community-based data supports higher weight gain and excess body weight in PCOS. Weight gain over 10 years among women with PCOS is significantly greater than in unaffected women in a longitudinal community-based study (mean difference 2.6kg 95% CI 1.2-4.0) [387]. Weight gain escalates from adolescence and early vigilance and intervention is important. Central obesity increases over time with a progressive increase in waist hip ratio between 20 - 25 years and 40 - 45 years [115]. This is consistent with reports from a prospective birth cohort of increased weight gain in early adulthood in women with symptoms of or a diagnosis of PCOS compared with controls [388]. Overall rates of weight gain and excess weight are increased in PCOS. Obesity influences the phenotypic expression of PCOS, exacerbating metabolic, reproductive, and psychological features [279, 389]. Lipid abnormalities are increased independently in PCOS and are exacerbated by excess weight [386, 389, 390]. Central obesity is associated with more severe metabolic disturbance [389]. The prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and DM2 is further increased in women with PCOS with excess weight, especially in high-risk ethnic groups [391]. Conversely, weight loss reduces abdominal fat and insulin resistance and improves clinical features of PCOS (see Chapter 3) [294, 392]. 82 CONTENTS",

        "text": "INTRODUCTION Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders; it affects 5-10% of women at reproductive age worldwide [1]. In Egypt, PCOS shows as up to 26% of familial PCOS and 5.4% of women do not have a familial history [2]. Its hallmarks are biochemical and/or clinical hyperandrogenism in addition to chronic anovulation with subsequent menstrual disturbances such as oligo/amenorrhea [3]. Obesity, especially the truncal type, affects 17.2 % of Egyptian PCOS women [2]. It adversely influences the degree of associated insulin resistance, which in turn affects the androgen level; therefore, resulting in menstrual irregularity and hirsutism [4]. A previous study concluded that severe caloric restriction for weight reduction is associated with restoration of menstrual cycles [5]. However, long-term severe caloric restriction resulting in rapid weight loss, can lead to poor patient compliance; accordingly, the body gains its baseline weight within one year [6]. The increasing rates of obesity, among Egyptian population, are largely attributed to their lifestyles; including unhealthy dietary habits, like consuming the widely distributed junk, fast food coupled with increasing sedentary lifestyles, as it was reported that 63% of the Egyptian population at the age of twenty or more have sedentary lifestyles [7]. Recently, large studies investigated the impact of the lifestyle modification in PCOS women and suggested that modest weight loss, even as little as 5% from baseline body weight can positively affect hyperinsulinemia. As a result, it causes a decrease of androgens and normalization of menstrual cycles. Evidence supports the role of the healthcare providers in encouraging women with menstrual irregularities to change their lifestyle [8, 9]. Significance of the problem PCOS has always been considered as a systemic problem that carries many risks at the time of presentation and later in a woman's life. For example, infrequent menstrual flow carries 3-fold increased risks of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial carcinoma [10]. This stimulates the current study to evaluate the impact of a lifestyle modification program on menstrual irregularity among overweight or obese Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome, where Egyptian studies which investigated this topic are so limited. 2",

Methods: A quasi experimental research design was used to conduct this study on 82 women with polycystic ovarian syndrome at the Gynecology and Obesity clinics of Mansoura University Hospital, Egypt. Two groups were included; the study group received a lifestyle modification program for 48 weeks, while the control group was not subjected to this program. Three tools were used for data collection. The first was a structured questionnaire to assess the woman's general characteristics, anthropometric measurements, and menstrual pattern, the second was the Ferriman- Gallwey scale to assess the hirsutism score, while the third was 24-hours dietary recall to monitor food and drink intake. Results: After one year of lifestyle modification, the number of menstrual cycles significantly increased from 2.7 ±1.6 to 6.9 ±1.5 (t=12.26, p<0.001) in the study group compared to insignificant minor changes among the control group (t= 0.69, p= 0.488). Additionally, 58.5% were menstruating regularly compared to none in the control group (χ2=33.93, p<0.001). Conclusion: Participating in a lifestyle modification program was effective in reducing menstrual cycle's irregularity among overweight and obese women with PCOS. Thus, nurses need to be aware of and actively promote the benefits of lifestyle modification and supportive follow up for overweight/obese POCS women.

This aim was achieved through the present study finding which revealed a significant decrease in menstrual cycle irregularities among the study group after one year of lifestyle modification. Accordingly, the study hypothesis was confirmed, \"overweight or obese women with PCOS who participate in a lifestyle modification program experience less menstrual irregularity than those who do not participate.\" This study finding is consistent with previous studies that investigated the impact of lifestyle modification on managing PCOS symptoms among adult women. Such studies concluded that lifestyle modification results in weight loss with subsequent improvement of menstrual cycle irregularities and androgen excess [19-22]. The present study showed that among the study group with 8.7% weight reduction from the baseline value, frequency of amenorrhea and oligomenorrhea was significantly decreased and led more than half of the participants to have regular menstruation after one year of lifestyle modification compared to none at baseline. Similar to the present study, a previous study had analyzed the impact of a comprehensive lifestyle modification program on menstrual irregularities among 59 obese German girls with PCOS.

Our study recommended ‘energy-restricted diet’ for the study group and there were no specific recommendations for the control, which makes direct comparison with Ornstein’s study difficult, but we also found that menstrual patterns improved with weight loss. The reported significant increase in the number of the menstrual cycles may be related to the decrease in the stimulation of ovarian androgen production as a result of the associated reduction in hyperinsulinemia [19]. Using the Ferriman-Gallwey score, hirsutism showed a significant decrease in the study group compared to insignificant changes among the control group. Such finding is congruent with the finding of a prospective intervention study [28] conducted in Ain Shams maternity hospital, Egypt. It investigated the effectiveness of lifestyle modification; specifically, dietary counseling and exercise on PCOS symptoms in 64 women in their reproductive age. The investigators had concluded that women with PCOS who attained weight reduction as a result of lifestyle modification had showed a significant improvement in total hirsutism score. Such agreement between our finding and the Egyptian study finding [28] may be related to the improvement of the androgen excess level as a result of lifestyle modification that results in a decrease in hirsutism score. Conversely, the present study disagrees with Hoeger et al. [24], mentioned above, which did not find significant changes of hirsutism scores by lifestyle intervention and/or metformin use. Such disagreement may be explained by two rationales; firstly, it may be related to how Hoeger and his colleagues had evaluated the hirsutism score. As in the current study the researchers considered that most women with PCOS are using cosmetic methods to manage their hirsutism, thus the women enrolled in this study were instructed to omit the hair management for the two weeks preceding hirsutism evaluation, while in the Hoeger's study [24] the interval between the excessive hair management and assessing hirsutism score is not clear, whether it was the same, shorter, or longer time interval and whether clients continued to manage the 14",

The study group was provided with an instructional brochure to be used as a guide for the permitted and forbidden foods and behaviors. They were asked to accurately record their dietary intake daily for the week preceding the assigned clinic visit; using a 24-hour dietary recall. II. Control group On the other hand, the control group was not subjected to the lifestyle modification program. 3) Follow up schedule and Outcomes evaluation Initially for the 1st two months of enrollment, participants were followed through biweekly face-to-face interview that the nurse investigator went along with a registered dietitian at the Obesity clinic to monitor the participant's compliance with the lifestyle modification program. Then, they moved on monthly face-to-face interviews, giving a total number of fifteen face-to-face individual interviews by end of the study, including the initial interview. A telephone conversation with a pre assigned researcher was made to the client who found a difficulty in attending one or two biweekly/monthly interview. Attending the two educational sessions and a minimum number of ten follows up face-to-face/telephone interviews was considered as sufficient participation to stay in the study. Each interview took about 10-15 minutes. During this interview the investigators had to monitor the participant's compliance with the program by way of reviewing the 24-hours dietary recalls for the one week preceding the assigned interview. As well as, inquiring the clients verbally about the type and duration of performed exercise and their eating behavior during the same period. All the outcome measures including, anthropometric measures, menstrual history, and the hirsutism score were recorded at the initial assessment and were recorded again after one year of enrollment. 7",

Informed consent was obtained from each participant after clarifying the study aim and approach. Participants were assured about the confidentiality of their data as well they were informed that they have the right to withdraw at any time. Additionally, at the end of the study, clients who had been allocated to the control group were invited to be involved in the same lifestyle modification program, but separate from the intervention group, so that they were not disadvantaged. 7. Data analysis All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for windows version 17.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Continuous data were obtained at baseline and after 12 months follow- up period were expressed as mean ±SD and compared pre- and post-test scores in each group using paired t test. Categorical data were expressed in numbers and percent and compared using the χ2 test. The 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for the difference in means were calculated. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. RESULTS 1. General and Clinical Characteristics of the Groups Table 1 reveals that the general characteristics of the two groups were similar at the baseline (p >0.05). BMI for the study and control groups were almost identical (33.1 ±1.6 and 33.4 ±1.9 respectively; t= 0.77, p= 0.442). Most of the study and control groups (90.2% and 92.7% respectively) were obese, while the minorities (9.8% and 7.3% respectively) were overweight.

        "text": "1054 Socio-Cultural Perspective On Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Patients: From Lived Experience To Treatment Dietary changes may focus on avoiding certain foods or incorporating others believed to have therapeutic benefits’(Acharya, 2021), The sample data indicates that many PCOS patients have utilized various home remedies in addition to conventional medical treatments. For instance, one respondent mentioned that her mother prepared fresh vegetable juices specifically for managing PCOS. Others reported using specialized herbal teas or drinking ample water, which they believe helps in reducing stress. Many patients have incorporated regular exercise and adopted healthier dietary practices to improve their condition. One participant noted using a mixture of besin (gram flour) and shahad (honey) as a topical treatment for acne. Additionally, some patients integrate religious practices into their treatment regimen. For example, one individual recited Surah Al-Fatehah seven times over water and consumed it, believing it would aid in her recovery. Another patient mentioned reciting Surah Yaseen and Manzil, expressing her faith in Allah’s ability to cure her. Delay in seeking treatment connects the patients with unqualified practitioners and Pirs (saints) who provide them amulets or special waters, often further complicating the management of PCOS. These findings suggest that alongside medical treatments, ethno-medicinal approaches, including home remedies, exercise, balanced diet, and religious recitations, play a significant role in managing PCOS. Such integrative practices appear to complement conventional therapies and contribute positively to the overall treatment strategy for PCOS. Conclusions Socio-culture encompasses the interplay of social and cultural factors that shape human behavior, beliefs, and interactions within a community. Present research focused on how cultural, social, influence health, illness, and healthcare practices surround women with PCOS by specifically addressing social stigmas associated with PCOS. Societal criticism contributes to heightened stress among patients, exacerbating their condition. Particularly, individuals with low socio-economic status and low education were severely affected by the problem. Moreover, these condition presents numerous societal challenges that affect both personal identity and relationships of women and their experiences remain untapped. Married women often face societal judgment regarding infertility, while unmarried women grapple with fears of future infertility and concerns about beauty standards related to PCOS. Patients with PCOS frequently feel ashamed to discuss their condition openly which delays their consultation with healthcare professionals and leads to more severe complications. Cultural practices, including reliance on home remedies and treatments from unqualified practitioners, such as those providing amulets or special waters, often further complicate the management of PCOS. To reduce the burden of PCOS and its sensitization, education and public awareness programs are direly needed at all levels. References Acharya, R. (2021). Traditional Medicine Review.

High Few or no criteria fulfilled or the conclusions of the study are likely or very likely to be affected. Insufficient information Not enough information provided on methodological quality to be able to determine risk of bias. Data extraction Data, according to the selection criteria, were extracted from included studies using a specially developed data extraction form [604]. Information was collected on general details (title, authors, reference/source, country, year of publication, setting), participants (age, sex, inclusion/exclusion criteria, withdrawals/losses to follow-up, subgroups), results (point estimates and measures of variability, frequency counts for dichotomous variables, number of participants, intention-to-treat analysis) and validity results. Data extraction tables for each evidence review can be found in the supporting Technical report. Data synthesis In order to make a summary statement about the effect of the intervention and thus inform evidence-based recommendations, data were presented qualitatively by presenting the findings narratively in tables or discussion text; or quantitatively, using statistical methods such as meta-analyses. A meta-analysis is a statistical technique for combining (pooling) the results of a number of studies, that report data for the same outcome for the same intervention, to produce a summary statistic to represent the effect of one intervention compared to another. When high-quality trials are used, a meta-analysis summary statistic can be more powerful than an individual study to confirm or refute effectiveness of an intervention and thus to inform an evidence-based recommendation. Data were summarised statistically using meta-analyses if data were available, sufficiently homogenous, and of sufficient quality. Clinical homogeneity was satisfied when participants, interventions, outcome measures and timing of outcome measurement were considered to be similar. The Review Manager 5.3 software was used for meta- analyses. Where appropriate, subgroup analysis was conducted according to factors that may cause variations in outcomes, are likely to be a confounder, or may change the way the treatment works e.g. age, subtype or duration of treatment. These can be found in the supporting Technical report. 132 CONTENTS",

We cured his wife (barrenness) for him.” Similarly, the Prophet PBUH says: “Marry the kind and fertile women who will give birth to many children for I shall take pride in the great numbers of my ummah” (Nation) (Al-Bar et al., 2015; Altman, 2023; Deanna & Sachdev 2023; Forthingham, 2020; Society, 2008). Materials and Methods The researcher utilized anthropological research methods, specifically employing a descriptive approach covering Case Studies, In-depth interviews, and life histories. The study has provided detailed descriptions of these tools to explore the research questions (Singh, 2023). Case studies and life histories made it possible to gather thorough and specific information from a variety of sources, including observations, interviews, and documents, to have a deeper comprehension of the instances that were being investigated (Shahzad et al., 2017). Furthermore, the case study method was especially helpful for examining complicated or unusual phenomena in the real- world settings surrounding PCOS, providing insights into behaviors, processes, and outcomes that might not be captured through other research methods and offering workable solutions to particular problems or challenges faced by women with PCOS (Rashid et al., 2019). Materials and Methods For the present research, the research made use of purposeful sampling based on understanding of the study’s objectives. Firstly, female obstetric patients within a larger group of gynecology patients were identified. The focus was then narrowed to those diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), as determined by their Luteinizing Hormone (LH) test and abdominal ultrasound results, reviewed by physicians. The study specifically targeted married women experiencing infertility who were in their reproductive age and unmarried women who had reached puberty and were 14 years old and above. Given the qualitative nature of the study, a large sample size was not required. A total of 20 in-depth interviews, 06 case studies & 03 life histories were conducted. Results and Discussion Relationship between Occupation and Household Income The correlation analysis revealed a significant relationship between the two variables in the socio-economic survey: occupation and household income, as shown in Table 1. Socio- economic status has been linked to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). Specifically, women from lower socio-economic backgrounds were found at a higher risk of developing PCOS, which is often exacerbated by financial stress. Additionally, women who experienced low socio-economic status during childhood were also at increased risk (Azziz, 2011).

Our study recommended ‘energy-restricted diet’ for the study group and there were no specific recommendations for the control, which makes direct comparison with Ornstein’s study difficult, but we also found that menstrual patterns improved with weight loss. The reported significant increase in the number of the menstrual cycles may be related to the decrease in the stimulation of ovarian androgen production as a result of the associated reduction in hyperinsulinemia [19]. Using the Ferriman-Gallwey score, hirsutism showed a significant decrease in the study group compared to insignificant changes among the control group. Such finding is congruent with the finding of a prospective intervention study [28] conducted in Ain Shams maternity hospital, Egypt. It investigated the effectiveness of lifestyle modification; specifically, dietary counseling and exercise on PCOS symptoms in 64 women in their reproductive age. The investigators had concluded that women with PCOS who attained weight reduction as a result of lifestyle modification had showed a significant improvement in total hirsutism score. Such agreement between our finding and the Egyptian study finding [28] may be related to the improvement of the androgen excess level as a result of lifestyle modification that results in a decrease in hirsutism score. Conversely, the present study disagrees with Hoeger et al. [24], mentioned above, which did not find significant changes of hirsutism scores by lifestyle intervention and/or metformin use. Such disagreement may be explained by two rationales; firstly, it may be related to how Hoeger and his colleagues had evaluated the hirsutism score. As in the current study the researchers considered that most women with PCOS are using cosmetic methods to manage their hirsutism, thus the women enrolled in this study were instructed to omit the hair management for the two weeks preceding hirsutism evaluation, while in the Hoeger's study [24] the interval between the excessive hair management and assessing hirsutism score is not clear, whether it was the same, shorter, or longer time interval and whether clients continued to manage the 14",

Also, Hoeger et al. [24] conducted a clinical trial in New York; over one year, to study the effect of intensive lifestyle intervention and/or metformin on menstrual events among 38 overweight or obese women with PCOS. They found a significant restoration of ovulation and menstrual events only when the lifestyle modifications were implemented along with the medical treatment. Such agreement between the present study findings and the findings of the previously described two studies [23, 24] may be explained by the fact that insulin resistance is more likely to be associated with hyperinsulinemia, and it is evidenced that hyperinsulinemia acts as a leading cause of elevated androgen levels among PCOS women [25]. Based on that notion the researchers of the present study attributed the improvement of menstrual irregularities to the decrease in insulin resistance in the study group; that was evidenced by a significant reduction in the waist circumference at end of the study [26], causing a reduction in hyperinsulinemia, accordingly improving menstrual irregularity. Also, the present study investigated the changes in the number of menstrual cycles over the study period and revealed a significant increase in the study group compared to insignificant changes in the control group. Interestingly the present study results agreed with the findings of Ornstein et al. [27].

This suggests that exercise will improve these outcomes either in isolation or in combination with dietary intervention. In summary, previous work has suggested that exercise is superior to dietary intervention for improving glycaemic control and body composition in women PCOS, our data support this, although intuitively a combined exercise and dietary intervention approach may yield superior results in trials lasting more than 20 weeks. We suspect there are currently insufficient published data to separate the effects of exercise or dietary intervention. The limitations of this study are that exercise prescriptions vary slightly, and several studies used additional dietary interventions, although we conducted sub-analyses for BMI, WC and peak VO to account for this. Meta-analysis of continuous data is problematic; we 2 took the approach of adjusting for baseline difference in primary outcomes between allocation groups by measuring pre-versus post-intervention change. In many cases we were accurately able to calculate change in standard deviation, but in some cases where exact P- values were not provided in included study reports we had to use default values e.g. P<0.05 or P<0.001 in our calculations which may have introduced errors. Moreover these errors may have increased the measures of heterogeneity in our analyses which in some cases were high. Finally, we acknowledge that other factors, especially those related to volume of exercise (e.g. program duration) may explain some of the outcomes reported. Conclusions Our analyses suggest lifestyle intervention involving exercise are optimal for improving body composition parameters, insulin, lipid profile (especially total and LDL- cholesterol), CRP and cardio-respiratory fitness in women with PCOS.

Statistical analysis Meta-analyses were completed for continuous data by using the change in the mean and standard deviation of outcome measures as we did not wish to assume randomization would adjust for baseline imbalance. Change in post-intervention mean was calculated by subtracting baseline from post-intervention values. Change in the standard deviation of post- intervention outcomes was calculated by using Revman 5.0 (Nordic Cochrane Centre Denmark). Data required was either (i) 95% confidence interval data for pre-post intervention change for each group or when this was unavailable (ii) actual P values for pre-post intervention change for each group or if only the level of statistical significance was available (iii) we used default P values (e.g. P<0.05 becomes P=0.049, P<0.01 becomes P=0.0099 and P = not significant becomes P=0.05). A random effects inverse variance was used with the effects measure of mean difference. Heterogeneity was quantified using Cochrane Q test [15]. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by removing studies of exercise and diet, leaving exercise only studies, for the outcomes BMI, WC and peak VO . The purpose of sensitivity 2 analyses was to compare effect sizes of exercise alone with exercise and diet. Egger plots [16] were provided to assess the risk of publication bias (see supplementary files). Study quality was assessed by using a modified PEDro [17] score (out of 9 maximum score) as blinding participants difficult in lifestyle studies. We used a 5% level of significance and 95% confidence intervals, figures were produced using Revman 5.",

        "text": "3.4 Exercise interventions In women with PCOS, are exercise interventions (compared to different exercises) effective for improving anthropometric, metabolic, reproductive, fertility, quality of life and emotional wellbeing outcomes? Clinical need for the question Whilst not formally included in the diagnostic criteria, insulin resistance, is involved in the aetiology and clinical features of PCOS [336, 337]. Exercise ameliorates insulin resistance and offers a potentially effective intervention in PCOS, with some evidence of clinical benefit. In general populations, physical activity (any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure) and structured exercise (activity requiring physical effort, carried out to sustain or improve health and fitness), deliver clear health benefits, whilst sedentary behaviours (activities during waking hours in a seated or reclined position with energy expenditure less than 1.5 times resting metabolic rate) have adverse health impacts. Despite the potential for benefit, women with PCOS report receiving limited lifestyle advice and specific efficacy of different types and intensity of exercise is unclear and was prioritised in PCOS and its associated co-morbidities. Summary of systematic review evidence We did not identify any evidence in women with PCOS to answer the question and therefore the literature has been reviewed narratively. Summary of narrative review evidence Physical activity and formal exercise interventions are classified as aerobic/endurance (focusing on aerobic capacity/ fitness), resistance activities (targeting muscle mass and strength) or a combination, further sub-grouped by exercise intensity into light, moderate, vigorous or high-intensity [338] (Table 5). Two small RCTs are relevant in PCOS. Regular moderate intensity cycle exercise had greater metabolic benefit over 24 compared to 12 weeks, without impact on reproductive biomarkers [148, 339, 340]. Whilst 20 weeks of aerobic compared to combined exercise, superimposed on a high protein diet, showed similarly improved PCOS features [148, 287, 339, 341]. Small RCTs and high quality mechanistic studies (cohort and case control studies) show physical activity, including formal exercise (aerobic and muscle strengthening), improves body composition and clinical features [148, 206, 287, 290, 339, 341-349], compared to minimum or no interventions. These benefits occur independent of significant weight loss [290] and can occur with exercise alone [290, 350]. The mechanistic impacts of exercise and physical activity on cardiometabolic and reproductive features of PCOS are well described [339, 351-353]. While acknowledging the limitations in quality of evidence (sample size, study type, heterogeneity of interventions), improved glycaemic and reproductive outcomes, QoL and functional capacities have been shown [148, 287, 339, 349, 351-354]. Psychologically, limited community based/epidemiological studies show positive associations between self-reported physical activity and mental health status [206, 342] and vigorous exercise and better health outcomes in women with PCOS [355]. Conversely, there is an increase in sedentary behaviour documented in PCOS [356]. Mechanistically, insulin resistance, underpinned by insulin signalling pathway defects, is involved in the aetiology [336, 337] and clinical features of PCOS [336, 337, 357-359]. Moderate aerobic exercise improves insulin sensitivity short-term in PCOS [360]. Insulin resistance is also ameliorated in groups where exercise reduces DM2 risk [152, 361] and CVD factors [362, 363]. Similarly, resistance or weight-bearing exercise either alone or in combination with aerobic exercise improves health outcomes in groups [364-367]. In general populations, physical activity and structured exercise deliver metabolic, cardiovascular, and psychosocial benefits, whether alone or combined with diet changes [368-370]. Sedentary behaviours link to all-cause mortality and adverse health impacts [371, 372], whilst aerobic and resistance exercise reduce cardiometabolic risk factors [373]. Health impacts of exercise therapy may also reduce long-term healthcare costs [374]. Overall, current guidelines for the general population recommend 150 minutes of exercise per week, with 90 minutes at moderate to high intensity [338, 375-382] (Table 5).

A weight, and reproductive and metabolic features in PCOS moderate energy reduction diet (500 to 1,000 kcal/day [19]. reduction) reduces body weight by 7% to 10% over a period of 6 to 12 months. Simple and practical tips that Pharmacological therapy in PCOS can be covered in minutes in medical consultation There is currently no ideal medical PCOS therapy that include targeting fruit juice, soft drinks, portion sizes and fully reverses underlying hormonal disturbances and high-fat foods. Incorporating simple moderate physical treats all clinical features. The OCP does improve hyper- androgenism and insulin sensitisers (primarily Met- formin) reduce insulin resistance in PCOS [80]. Generally, medical therapy is targeted to symptoms and should not be used as an alternative to lifestyle therapy in PCOS (Figure 2). Simple medical therapy is summarised in Appendix 2. The OCP has long been used in PCOS to induce regular cycles, protect the endometrium and treat hyperandrogenism. Mechanisms of action include a sig- nificant first pass hepatic effect, increasing production of hepatic proteins including sex hormone binding globulin. This reduces free circulating androgen levels, even with low dose OCPs. This important mechanism of antiandro- genic action does not occur with progestin alone or non- oral oestrogen containing contraceptive preparations. The OCP also reduces ovarian androgen production. There has been concerning data that the OCP can increase insulin resistance and worsen glucose tolerance. Studies are inadequate and data conflicting with more research needed, however consideration should be given Figure 2 Summary of a targeted approach to therapy in polycys- tic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

It is aimed at providing scientific evidence and well-balanced information on multi-disciplinary approach for the management of PCOS to health care providers in India. METHODOLOGY Systematic review of literature was conducted to provide the best possible evidence base for the GCPR. Existing guidelines, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, key cited articles relating to PCOS were reviewed by a group of doctors and recommendations relevant to Indian scenario were framed. The recommendations were discussed by an expert panel of gynecologists, physicians, ultrasonologists, endocrinologists, dematologists, and pediatricians in a series of meetings. GCPR for each section of the guidelines were discussed and where there was little or no evidence, the panel relied on experience, judgment and consensus to make their recommendations. The current consensus GCPR are developed in accordance to the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) protocol for standardized production of clinical practice guidelines. Recommendations are based on clinical importance (graded as A: strongly recommended, B: suggested, and C: unresolved) coupled by four intuitive levels of evidence (1 = ‘at least one randomized controlled trial (RCT) or meta-analysis of RCTs’, 2 = ‘at least one non-randomized or non-controlled, prospective epidemiological study’, 3 = ‘cross- sectional or observational or surveillance or pilot study’ and 4 = ‘existing guideline or consensus expert opinion on extensive patient experience or review’).[9] RISK FACTORS FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF PCOS Current Evidence: Figure 1: Modified Ferriman-Gallwey hirsutism scoring system Several risk factors are associated with the incidence of PCOS, but not all are causative or predisposing factors for PCOS.

It is aimed at providing scientific evidence and well-balanced information on multi-disciplinary approach for the management of PCOS to health care providers in India. METHODOLOGY Systematic review of literature was conducted to provide the best possible evidence base for the GCPR. Existing guidelines, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, key cited articles relating to PCOS were reviewed by a group of doctors and recommendations relevant to Indian scenario were framed. The recommendations were discussed by an expert panel of gynecologists, physicians, ultrasonologists, endocrinologists, dematologists, and pediatricians in a series of meetings. GCPR for each section of the guidelines were discussed and where there was little or no evidence, the panel relied on experience, judgment and consensus to make their recommendations. The current consensus GCPR are developed in accordance to the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) protocol for standardized production of clinical practice guidelines. Recommendations are based on clinical importance (graded as A: strongly recommended, B: suggested, and C: unresolved) coupled by four intuitive levels of evidence (1 = ‘at least one randomized controlled trial (RCT) or meta-analysis of RCTs’, 2 = ‘at least one non-randomized or non-controlled, prospective epidemiological study’, 3 = ‘cross- sectional or observational or surveillance or pilot study’ and 4 = ‘existing guideline or consensus expert opinion on extensive patient experience or review’).[9] RISK FACTORS FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF PCOS Current Evidence: Figure 1: Modified Ferriman-Gallwey hirsutism scoring system Several risk factors are associated with the incidence of PCOS, but not all are causative or predisposing factors for PCOS. However, Development of IR and dysregulation of lipid metabolism are seen their presentation is indicative of the incidence of PCOS.

These factors, and the high prevalence of PCOS, suggest that there could be an evolutionary basis for the syndrome (15,16,39). Evolutionary medicine has changed the paradigm for understanding PCOS, acknowledging many of the contributing lifestyle and environmental factors that facilitate the observed metabolic and clinical features and that are also shared with related metabolic diseases (8). These “mismatch disorders” are estimated to make a significant contribution to chronic disease in developed countries and a growing proportion of disability and death in developing nations (3). According to the Global Burden of Disease Study, the human diet is now the leading risk factor for morbidity and mortality worldwide (3). In keeping with these findings, diet is recognized as one of the major contributors to the growing prevalence of PCOS globally (7,40). Dietary and environmental factors are hypothesized to have an impact on developmental programming of susceptible gene variants in women with PCOS (41–43). Extensive experimental evidence suggests that prenatal androgen exposure may play a role in the pathogenesis of PCOS-like syndromes in animal models (19,44–46). The discovery of naturally-occurring PCOS phenotypes in non-human primates supports a survival advantage of a hyperandrogenic, insulin resistant phenotype with delayed fertility (47). In humans, the origin of excess androgens may be from maternal, fetal or placental sources. In addition, emerging and concerning evidence suggests that EDC may contribute to altered fetal programming and play a role in the pathogenesis of PCOS (41,48). In-utero genomic programming of metabolic and endocrine pathways can increase the susceptibility of offspring to develop PCOS following exposure to specific nutritional and environmental conditions (45). This view of the pathogenesis of PCOS is consistent with the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) model proposed by Neel (49). Postnatal exposure to lifestyle and environmental factors, such as poor-quality diet and EDC, may activate epigenetically programmed pathways that further promote the observed features of PCOS. Dietary and lifestyle interventions have demonstrated that many of the clinical, metabolic and endocrine features of PCOS can be reversed (7,50,51). Lifestyle-induced changes in the gastrointestinal tract microbiome are another significant factor in the aetiology of PCOS (52,53). Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota has been hypothesised to play a role in increased gastrointestinal permeability, initiating chronic inflammation, IR and hyperandrogenism (40). Numerous studies have reported reduced alpha diversity of the microbiome that has been associated with the metabolic, endocrine and clinical features observed in women with PCOS (54,55). The resulting dysbiosis has been shown to be reversible after interventions aimed at improving diet quality or treatment with probiotics or synbiotics (50,51,56–58). A unified evolutionary theory of the pathogenesis of PCOS proposes that ancient genetic polymorphisms that were aligned with the environment of that era, resulted in an adaptive survival advantage in offspring in ancestral populations (14–16,28). When these same genetic variants are exposed to modern lifestyle and environmental influences, maladaptive physiological responses occur.

Asadversehealth outcomes are commonly associated with PCOS [3,4,6], this dietary pattern may therefore result in healthbenefits.

Strengths to our study include the large population of women with and without PCOS from a community-based population in contrast to the majority of the existing research assessing diet and PCOS. This minimises selection bias. This is also more likely to capture a lower proportion ofwomenwithPCOSwithamoresevereclinicalphenotypeandahigherBMIwhotypicallypresent to clinical services and are captured in research studies [56]. While the use of self-report PCOS is a limitation,thenatureofthisresearchmeansthatitisnotfeasibletoclinicallyverifyPCOSorcontrol status. It is also not possible to determine the PCOS phenotype or which diagnostic criteria were usedindiagnosis. However,giventhattheRotterdamcriteriawerefirstpublishedin2004[57],itis also most likely that the majority of women self-reporting diagnosed PCOS in Survey 4, conducted in 2006, would have been diagnosed based on NIH criteria. There are also some other limitations to our study. We report here 58% participant retention compared to baseline levels 13 years prior which may indicate bias and limit generalisability. However, no differences between completors and non-completors has previously been reported indicating a likely minimal effect of attrition on outcomes [36]. Although the FFQ is a validated measure of assessing nutritional intake, we are not able to assess the contribution of dietary patterns to the development or severity of PCOS due to the study design and report here only associations between dietary patterns and PCOS status. Further,thetotalvarianceexplainedbyeachfactorwasintermediatecomparedwithpreviousfactor analyses conducted in different age groups [29,58,59]; however, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of samplingadequacywas0.78,exceedingtherecommendedvalueof0.6;andBartlett'stestofSphericity achieved statistical significance indicating the correlations in the data set are appropriate for factor analysis.

Conclusions In conclusion, we report for the first time the independent association of PCOS status with self-reported dietary patterns, specifically a Mediterranean diet pattern. This may indicate an improvement in the quality of dietary intake following a diagnosis of PCOS. We also report no increaseindietarypatternshighinnon-core,meatortake-awayfoodsdespiteahigherbodyweight. Combined with our prior research showing healthier intake but higher caloric consumption, it appears that women with PCOS may have a greater appetite and are more overweight, despite a healthier diet. Future research should examine the contribution of dietary patterns to the incidence and severity of PCOS and the potential for modification of dietary patterns in the lifestyle managementofPCOS.

        "text": "3.3 Dietary interventions In women with PCOS, are diet interventions (compared to no diet or different diets) effective for improving weight loss, metabolic, fertility, and emotional wellbeing outcomes? Clinical need for the question Specific dietary composition in lifestyle interventions remains controversial. Given the general recommendations to reduce caloric (energy) intake, rather than modifying macronutrient composition, the widespread promotion of specific dietary composition in PCOS and the limited comparative research on efficacy of specific dietary macronutrient approaches in PCOS, this clinical question was prioritised. Summary of systematic review evidence Four articles reporting three studies were identified to answer this question. One RCT with a moderate risk of bias investigated the changes in anthropometric, metabolic and non-fertility outcomes by comparing a high protein diet to a high carbohydrate diet [308]; one RCT with a low risk of bias investigating the changes in anthropometric and metabolic outcomes by comparing a DASH (dietary approaches to stop hypertension) diet with a control diet [328, 329]; and one RCT with a high risk of bias investigating the changes in anthropometric and metabolic outcomes by comparing a high protein diet with a normal protein diet [330]. There was no difference for the majority of the anthropometric, metabolic, fertility, non-fertility, QoL and emotional wellbeing outcomes, however, regardless of the type of diet, the overall finding was that a diet aimed at reducing weight was of benefit to women with PCOS. Summary of narrative review evidence Given the limitations in evidence in PCOS, evidence was also sought from the general population. A systematic review [331] and more recent large scale studies [332] show that in the general population, there is no benefit of any one diet type and that hormone levels including insulin do not predict responses. Given the above evidence and other systematic reviews in the general population that reported similar or less weight loss and compliance for a low fat diet compared to other approaches [333, 334], and a large RCT reported similar changes in weight for a range of reduced energy diets with different macronutrient content over two years [335], the assertions that specific dietary composition has selective long term advantages at this stage appears to be unjustified.

Evidence based guidelines recommend achieving this through a combination of diet, exercise or behaviouralmanagement[12]. The optimal dietary strategy as part of lifestyle management in PCOS remains controversial. We reported in a recent systematic review that the controlled clinical literature found no difference in the majority of anthropometric, reproductive, metabolic or psychological outcomes for a range of dietary approaches including higher protein, higher carbohydrate, lower glycaemic index or monounsaturated fat-enriched diets [13]. Despite this, a range of dietary approaches may be prescribedbyhealthprofessionals[14]. Whileevidence-basedNationalHealthandMedicalCouncil approvedAustralianguidelinesoutlinetheprinciplesofdietarymanagementforPCOS[12],theeffect of these guidelines on actual dietary prescription by health professionals and subsequent dietary intake by women with PCOS is not known.

There however remains uncertaintyastothequalityofdietaryintakeinwomenwithPCOS. Assessment of dietary patterns offers an additional way of comprehensively assessing dietary intake. Rather than assessing single nutrients in isolation, dietary pattern analysis identifies underlying dietary characteristics of the study population in which the consumption of foods that areeatentogethercanbederived. Inparticular,exploratoryapproachesorposterioridietarypattern analysessuchasprincipalcomponentsanalysis,whicharenothypothesisdriven,groupscorrelated food groups into uncorrelated factors termed dietary patterns [22,23].

        "text": "2.2 Depressive and anxiety symptoms, screening and treatment In women with PCOS, what is the prevalence and severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms and should they be screened? In women with PCOS, what is the most effective tool/method to assess depression and/or anxiety? Clinical need for the questions The prevalence and severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms are increased in PCOS. Psychological conditions impact on QoL and are likely to influence engagement in lifestyle interventions and self-management in PCOS. Hormonal medications can influence mood in the general population, although literature in PCOS is limited [197]. Effective, readily available screening tools are available for clinical practice, yet uptake and recognition of psychological symptoms in PCOS appears limited internationally. A large international survey has shown that most women report psychological issues are under-recognised [13] and less than 5% are satisfied with emotional support and counselling. Given the prevalence and severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms and the dissatisfaction expressed by women in this area, these clinical questions were prioritised. Summary of systematic review evidence A systematic review was not completed for the first question and the review for the second question did not identify any evidence in women with PCOS to answer this question. Summary of narrative review evidence These areas were reviewed narratively, based on clinical expertise. Depression: Depressive symptoms and depression are more common in PCOS [109], with daily fatigue, sleep disturbances and diminished interest prominent [195]. A meta-analysis of 10 studies reported increased depressive symptom scores in 44% with PCOS versus 17% in controls (OR: 4.03, 95% CI: 2.96-5.5, p<0.01) [198], which persisted in BMI matched studies. A meta-analysis of 910 women with PCOS and 1347 controls reported higher depression scores in PCOS [199], although these may not have been clinically significant. A meta-analysis of 26 studies including 4716 participants from 14 countries [200], noted scores were not in a clinically significant range in half of studies, and others were consistent with mild depression. A recent meta-analysis of 23 studies with rigorous inclusion criteria including physician diagnosis of PCOS [201], showed increased moderate/severe depressive symptoms (OR4.18, 95% CI: 2.68-6.52) with a prevalence of depression of 36.6% in PCOS (IQR: 22.3, 50.0%) and 14.2% in controls (IQR: 10.7, 22.2%), independent of obesity and seen in both clinic and community recruits. Limitations included relatively small sample sizes and limited formal diagnosis of depression on clinical assessment. Also, a large population-based registry study [202] showing an increased adjusted risk of depression in PCOS and a large hospital database study documented depression in PCOS (9.8%), compared to those without a recorded diagnosis of PCOS (4.6%) [203]. Overall, women with PCOS have a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms and depression, independent of obesity. 60 CONTENTS",

Living in a society with such disease like PCOS may depress the self-consciousness and lower self-stem of patient. ‘The cultural perception about the women role in a society is highly valued. As the reproductive inability, of women or infertility due to PCOS lead to feeling inadequacy and failure in society in which motherhood is highly valued (Dewailly et al., 2010). A PCOS patient also faces social stigma that had a great effect on the personality of patient in socio- cultural perspective. ‘Some symptoms of PCOS like infertility, obesity, unwanted hair growth causes social stigma in patients and causes anxiety, depression, and a negative image of body (Cooney et al., 2017). This all impart a negative effect between socio-cultural factors such family relationships, work, employment, and the patient (Hudson, 2008; Joham et al., 2022; Kaur et al., 2021). Socio- cultural factors, combined with socio-economic status, significantly impact individuals' lives. For example, a PCOS patient with a low socio-economic status may be unable to afford treatments for symptoms such as hirsutism, obesity, and infertility. These symptoms, exacerbated by social stigmas and cultural norms, can lead to body image issues and diminished self-esteem. Consequently, these factors indirectly affect women's ability to pursue higher education, secure high-paying jobs, and access other career opportunities (Di Fede et al., 2009). When managing a chronic disease, patients strive to improve their lifestyle and live contentedly with their condition. To achieve this, they employ various coping mechanisms to address social stigmas, cultural norms, and other social and medical challenges. These coping strategies include maintaining a healthy diet (Shahid et al., 2022), engaging in regular exercise and physical activities, practicing stress-relief meditation, minimizing unnecessary obligations, fostering positive social connections, seeking peer support, and avoiding negative coping methods such as alcohol and substance use (Wilder & Pype, 2021). The symptoms of PCOS are conspicuous and often conflict with societal cultural norms for women. Exploring the socio-cultural perspective on the personality of individuals living with PCOS involves understanding the intricate interplay between cultural norms, societal expectations, and individual experiences (Pathak & Nichter, 2015). In various cultural contexts, femininity and womanhood are frequently associated with fertility, physical appearance, and overall health. For women with PCOS, symptoms such as irregular menstruation, hirsutism, and infertility can challenge these traditional ideals of femininity, potentially impacting their self-concept and social identity (Becker & Nachtigal, 2019). These socio-cultural factors have contributed to the formation of social stigmas surrounding PCOS. The stigma associated with PCOS related symptoms, such as weight gain and acne, can lead to feelings of shame and social isolation, adversely affecting the psychosocial well-being of affected individuals. Additionally, cultural beliefs and gendered expectations shape the experiences of women with PCOS, influencing their self-esteem, body image, and interpersonal relationships (Simbar, 2014). Within the context of socio-cultural factors, socio-economic status also influences the lives of PCOS patients. Socio-economic status encompasses factors such as income, education, occupation, and access to resources, all of which significantly impact the experiences and outcomes of individuals living with PCOS. Number of researches indicate that lower socio- economic status is associated with a higher prevalence and severity of PCOS. Individuals from Migration Letters",

        "text": "3.2 Behavioural interventions In women with PCOS, are behavioural interventions (compared to different types of behavioural interventions) effective for improving anthropometric, metabolic, reproductive, fertility, quality of life and emotional wellbeing outcomes? Clinical need for the question With weight gain increasing in women, and even higher rates of weight gain shown in PCOS, preventive strategies area needed [314, 315]. Previous lifestyle intervention studies in PCOS have involved short-term dietary interventions with or without an exercise component. Dietary intervention studies have shown benefit with weight loss [314], however retention and sustainability prove challenging, suggesting a need for additional strategies. Behavioural and cognitive behavioural intervention approaches target behaviours, their antecedents and consequences and cognitions that maintain positive energy balance and promote weight gain [316] and are common in weight management. Behaviour therapy results in significantly greater weight loss than placebo, and behaviour/cognitive behaviour therapy combined with diet and exercise has efficacy. Given the need to improve adherence and impact of lifestyle interventions in PCOS, this question was prioritised. Summary of systematic review evidence We did not identify any evidence in women with PCOS to answer the question and therefore the literature has been reviewed narratively. Summary of narrative review evidence A multidisciplinary model of care with a dietitian, health psychologist, gynaecologist and endocrinologist, in adolescents with PCOS, showed that a ‘behavioural intervention’ enhanced weight loss when combined with dietary consultation, compared to receiving neither or dietary advice only [317]. The intervention was not well defined or replicable and metabolic, reproductive and psychosocial outcomes were not assessed. Two RCT’s included behavioural lifestyle components yet had minimal detail on the theoretical framework or behavioural components. These compared comprehensive lifestyle intervention (diet, behaviour and physical activity) over 24 weeks with placebo [318, 319] with variable but limited benefits. In this context, recommendations on behavioural lifestyle interventions in women with PCOS are informed by data from general populations. A comprehensive systematic review of lifestyle interventions in populations at risk of type 2 diabetes (DM2) or cardiovascular disease (CVD), summarised key success factors in lifestyle interventions [320]. Behavioural change techniques in combination with diet and exercise interventions, increased weight loss over diet and/or physical activity alone [320]. Self-management has positive impacts [320] and family support improves outcomes, [320]. Mode of delivery and trained intervention facilitator, setting and intensity didn’t impact outcomes [320]. Overall, this underpins international guidelines recommending integration of: 1/ established behaviour change techniques 2/ self-management/self-monitoring and 3/ social support to preventative and treatment lifestyle interventions [320, e.g., 321]. Combining behavioural/cognitive behavioural weight loss components with intensive interventions, including very low calorie diets and weight loss medications, also improves weight loss than these interventions alone [322-325]. Guidelines highlight the need for resources (e.g., written, audio-visual) and the potential for e-health to supplement face to face support with strategies including; goal-setting, self-monitoring, stimulus control, problem solving, assertiveness training, slowing the rate of eating, reinforcing changes, and relapse prevention. Continued contact after treatment (face-to-face or telephone) also improves weight-loss maintenance. More intensive behavioural interventions induce greater weight loss [326]. In the general population, behavioural and cognitive behavioural interventions have strong empirical support and are recommended in international guidelines on the treatment of excess weight [e.g., 321, 327].

Conceptual framework of the unified evolutionary theory Comprehensive International Guidelines have made 166 recommendations for the assessment and management of PCOS (38). We believe the current unified evolutionary theory of the pathogenesis of PCOS provides a conceptual framework that may help practitioners and patients understand the development of PCOS symptoms and pathology in the context of our modern lifestyle and environment. It will hopefully contribute to improved communication, result in improved feelings of empowerment over the personal manifestations of PCOS, improve compliance, reduce morbidity, increase quality of life and inform future research (figure 3). Figure 3. Impact of the unified theory on the management of polycystic ovary syndrome 3.10. Explanation to Women Diagnosed with PCOS “Polycystic ovary syndrome is a problem that is inherited from both of your parents. The inherited genes are activated by a range of dietary and environmental factors that can cause a number of symptoms. These include weight gain, irregular periods, acne, excess hair growth, hair loss, anxiety and depression. Women with PCOS are also at risk of developing a range of other problems throughout their lifetime if they are not adequately treated. These include gestational diabetes, type 2 diabetes, heart disease and fertility problems. All of these symptoms and problems can be treated, controlled and reversed with appropriate lifestyle changes. These include a healthy",

SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A total of 50 women with PCOS Dr. Madhu Jain, (Rotterdam criteria, 2003) and 50 age and weight matched healthy controls were selected 11, Lal Bhadur Shastri Colony, and serum melatonin estimation was done in both the groups and correlated with serum Karaundi Crossing, total testosterone levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a case‑control study, detailed Varanasi ‑ 221 005, history, clinical examination and hormonal evaluation [basal levels of leutinizing hormone, Uttar Pradesh, India.

For melatonin estimation, blood samples were collected between Received: 27‑09‑2013 12:00 am and 04:00 am on day 2nd of menstrual cycle and analyzed by using commercially Review completed: 27‑11‑2013 Accepted: 31‑12‑2013 available enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay kit. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Student’s t‑test was used to compare the significant difference in mean values between cases and control groups. Chi‑square test was used to test the significant association between the qualitative variables. Linear correlation coefficient and regression analysis were done to see the amount and direction of relationship between quantitative variables. RESULTS: The mean melatonin level was observed to be significantly increased in patients (63.27 ± 10.97 pg/mL) than in controls (32.51 ± 7.55 pg/mL). Melatonin was found to be raised in all the cases of PCOS (above cut‑off value of ≥45 pg/mL, P < 0.001). Total testosterone level was also raised in 72% of patients. Melatonin levels were found to be positively associated with increased testosterone (P < 0.001). In regression analysis using melatonin as dependent variable and testosterone as an independent variable, the value of R2 × 100 (percent variation) was found to be 72.1%. CONCLUSIONS: Women with PCOS have significantly raised serum melatonin levels and hyperandrogenemia along with increased number of atretic follicles. Further studies are required to establish a definite role of melatonin in PCOS cases with disturbed hormonal milieu. This could open up the way for therapeutic role of melatonin in treatment of patients suffering from PCOS.

In essence, 117 we allowed PCOS to have a variety of definitions in order to more clearly define common 118 phenotypes or features irrespective of the definition used. 119 The Task Force drafted the initial report, following a consensus process via electronic 120 communication, which was then reviewed and critiqued by the AES Board of Directors. No 121 section was finalized until all members were satisfied with the contents, and minority opinions 122 noted. Statements were not included that were not supported by peer-reviewed evidence. 123 124 2) CURRENT DEFINITIONS OF PCOS 125 Currently, two definitions of PCOS are in widespread use. The first arose from the 126 proceedings of an expert conference sponsored in part by the National Institute of Child Health 127 and Human Disease (NICHD) of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) on April 16-18, 128 1990. During the meeting all participants were surveyed regarding their perception of what 129 features formed part of PCOS, and Drs. Zawadski and Dunaif summarized these findings in the 130 meeting proceedings (9). They concluded that the major criteria for PCOS “should include (in 131 order of importance) : i) hyperandrogenism and/or hyperandrogenemia, ii) oligo-ovulation, [and 132 the] iii) exclusion of other known disorders”. This survey identified PCOS as an androgen 133 excess disorder of exclusion, with an ovarian etiology and/or consequences. 134 Another expert conference was convened in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, May 1-3, 2003 135 sponsored in part by the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) 136 and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) (10, 11). The meeting 137 proceedings recommended that PCOS be defined when at least two of the following three 138 features were present: i) oligo and/or anovulation, ii) clinical and/or biochemical signs of 139 hyperandrogenism, and iii) polycystic ovaries. These criteria also recognize that other androgen 140 excess or related disorders should be excluded prior to assigning the diagnosis of PCOS. 7",

Clinical need for the question One of the leading causes of female infertility is tubal pathology, potentially affecting around 30% of infertile women [469]. The diagnostic assessment of infertility often includes tubal testing by hysterosalpingography or laparoscopy as outlined in the WHO evidence report on infertility management in PCOS. PCOS is the most frequent cause of anovulation in infertile women and ovulation induction is the most common treatment, however there is little information about the prevalence of tubal pathology or the need for intrauterine insemination with normal semen analysis in infertile women with PCOS. Summary of narrative evidence A systematic review was not conducted to answer this question and this was reviewed narratively based on clinical expertise. There is no evidence to support that hydrosalpinges or other fallopian tube disorders are more frequent in PCOS women [470]. Yet the assessment of tubal patency is considered in infertility workup, as outlined in the WHO evidence report on infertility treatment in PCOS. Whilst adverse effects from this intervention are not common, false positives have been described and tubal patency testing may be more appropriate when targeted to those at increased risk of tubal infertility [471]. In this context, consideration of risks for tubal pathology are clinically appropriate, including: a. Previous abdominal or pelvic sepsis, b. Previous pelvic and/or abdominal surgery c. Cases of recurrent acute pelvic pain [472], d. History of sexual transmitted diseases or pelvic inflammatory disease or e. Endometriosis Recommendations 5.1.3 CCR In women with PCOS and infertility due to anovulation alone with normal semen analysis, the risks, benefits, costs and timing of tubal patency testing should be discussed on an individual basis. 5.1.4 CCR Tubal patency testing should be considered prior to ovulation induction in women with PCOS where there is suspected tubal infertility. Justification If the patient has a clinical history of factors associated with tubal infertility it was deemed that hysterosalpingography could be considered, consistent with routine assessment of infertility. Hysterosalpingography requires dilation of the cervix that generally produces some discomfort, false positives are described and other related complications are uncommon. A lack of evidence to guide practice was noted in PCOS when considering these recommendations, however general population approaches were judged as applicable in this population, where other risk factors are present.

        "text": "5.9a In-vitro fertilisation In women with PCOS, is stimulated In-vitro fertilisation/Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection effective for improving fertility outcomes? Clinical need for the question Ovulation induction therapies are first and second line in infertility management in women with PCOS, anovulation and no other fertility factors. Yet resistance to and failure of ovulation induction therapies and inability to overcome other concomitant causes of infertility means that Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) therapies including In-vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) used in male factor infertility, have a role in PCOS. IVF has risks and limitations, yet also offers the opportunity for pregnancy and live birth. Challenges exist across the diversity of protocols available for IVF and concerns in PCOS including OHSS, high oestradiol levels, accelerated endometrial maturation and optimally the use of “freeze all” interventions. The clinical practice questions here include indications, timing and comparative efficacy with other treatments, yet RCTs in this area are very limited in women with anovulatory PCOS. Summary of systematic review evidence We did not identify any evidence in women with PCOS to answer the question and therefore the literature has been reviewed narratively. Summary of narrative review evidence There are no RCTs identified by the guideline development team, comparing stimulated IVF ± ICSI therapy with ovulation induction in women diagnosed with PCOS. The role of IVF in PCOS was explored by the WHO guidance group, and the review and recommendations were considered here by the GDG in making their recommendations [464]. Factors that influenced considerations here include access, cost and risks. The patient and societal benefits of ovulation induction compared with IVF treatments in anovulatory PCOS women require RCTs and systematic analysis. Outcomes as time to conception, cost of therapy, QoL, OHSS risk, multiple pregnancy, miscarriage and livebirth rates should be investigated. Recommendations 5.9.1 CCR In the absence of an absolute indication for IVF ± ICSI, women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility could be offered IVF as third line therapy where first or second line ovulation induction therapies have failed. 5.9.2 CPP In women with anovulatory PCOS, the use of IVF is effective and when elective single embryo transfer is used, multiple pregnancies can be minimised. 5.9.3 CPP Women with PCOS undergoing IVF ± ICSI therapy need to be counselled prior to starting treatment including on: ● availability, cost and convenience ● increased risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ● options to reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation. Justification The GDG deemed IVF should be considered after failed ovulation induction treatment with high pregnancy rates per cycle, especially in younger women. Given the risks and the high costs that can be prohibitive for many patients, IVF should be considered third line medical therapy. It was noted that conception and delivery are highly valued by health professionals and women with PCOS and even when cost and risks are increased, many may elect to undertake IVF. Health Professionals must weigh benefits and risk when advising PCOS patients to enable an informed decision.

        "text": "5.7 Laparoscopic ovarian surgery In women with PCOS, is ovarian surgery effective for improving fertility outcomes? Clinical need for the question Observations that women with PCOS resumed regular ovulation following ovarian biopsies, led to development of surgical wedge resection via laparotomy [543]. Observational data looked promising, but surgery was surpassed by ovulation induction agents, until less invasive laparoscopic surgery [544], with potential for less adhesions and lower cost. Minor methodological variations are reported (electrocautery, laser vaporization, multiple ovarian biopsies and others), all seemingly with effects on the endocrine profile. OHSS and multiple pregnancy risks are lower than with other options, but other risks potentially are higher, and clarification of the role of LOS, particularly in comparison to other treatments, is needed in infertile women with PCOS. Summary of systematic review evidence Laparoscopic ovarian surgery versus metformin Two medium quality RCTs (level II) (published across three papers) with a moderate risk of bias compared LOS to metformin and found that there was insufficient evidence to make a recommendation about LOS compared to metformin for live birth rate per patient, ovulation rate per cycle, pregnancy rate per cycle, pregnancy rate per patient, multiple pregnancies, miscarriage rate per pregnancy, adverse effects and QoL [545-547] largely because the evidence was conflicting. One RCT reported that LOS was better than metformin for ovulation (OR 2.05; [1.4–2.9] p=0.001) and pregnancy rate (per cycle: OR 2.19 [1.03–4.63] p=0.03; per patient: OR 2.47 [1.05–5.81] p=0.03) [545] and the other study reported that metformin was better than LOS for live birth rate (metformin: 82.1%, LOS: 64.5%, p<0.05), pregnancy rate per cycle (metformin: 18.6%, LOS: 13.4%, p<0.05), and miscarriage rate (metformin: 15.4%, LOS:29.0%, p<0.05) [546, 547]. Both medium quality single centre studies had a small sample size and moderate risk of bias and therefore need to be interpreted with caution. Laparoscopic ovarian surgery versus clomiphene cirtrate Two high quality RCTs (level II) with a low risk of bias compared LOS to CC [548, 549] and found that there was no difference between LOS and CC for live birth rate per patient and pregnancy rate per patient, ovulation rate per patient and miscarriage rate per pregnancy [548, 549]. There was insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of LOS over CC for multiple pregnancies [548, 549]. Laparoscopic ovarian surgery versus clomiphene critrate + metformin Three low to moderate quality RCTs with low to moderate risk of bias compared LOS to CC plus metformin (all three studies reported in Farquhar 2012 systematic review [496]). Meta-analyses found that CC plus metformin (CC+M) was better than LOS for live birth rate, but there was no difference for pregnancy rate per patient, multiple pregnancy rate, or miscarriage rate per pregnancy [496]. There was insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of LOS over CC plus metformin for ovulation rate per patient, and OHSS [496]. Laparoscopic ovarian surgery versus aromatase inhibitors Three RCTs with low risk of bias [493-495] compared letrozole to LOS and found that there was insufficient evidence of a difference between letrozole and LOS. One of the RCTs in 147 women with CC resistance found that letrozole was better than LOS for ovulation rate per cycle [493], however the evidence is of low certainty. The systematic review by Farquhar 2012 [496] combined these studies in meta-analysis for pregnancy rate per patient, multiple pregnancy rate per pregnancy and miscarriage rate per pregnancy and there was no statistical difference between the two interventions.

We cured his wife (barrenness) for him.” Similarly, the Prophet PBUH says: “Marry the kind and fertile women who will give birth to many children for I shall take pride in the great numbers of my ummah” (Nation) (Al-Bar et al., 2015; Altman, 2023; Deanna & Sachdev 2023; Forthingham, 2020; Society, 2008). Materials and Methods The researcher utilized anthropological research methods, specifically employing a descriptive approach covering Case Studies, In-depth interviews, and life histories. The study has provided detailed descriptions of these tools to explore the research questions (Singh, 2023). Case studies and life histories made it possible to gather thorough and specific information from a variety of sources, including observations, interviews, and documents, to have a deeper comprehension of the instances that were being investigated (Shahzad et al., 2017). Furthermore, the case study method was especially helpful for examining complicated or unusual phenomena in the real- world settings surrounding PCOS, providing insights into behaviors, processes, and outcomes that might not be captured through other research methods and offering workable solutions to particular problems or challenges faced by women with PCOS (Rashid et al., 2019). Materials and Methods For the present research, the research made use of purposeful sampling based on understanding of the study’s objectives. Firstly, female obstetric patients within a larger group of gynecology patients were identified. The focus was then narrowed to those diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), as determined by their Luteinizing Hormone (LH) test and abdominal ultrasound results, reviewed by physicians. The study specifically targeted married women experiencing infertility who were in their reproductive age and unmarried women who had reached puberty and were 14 years old and above. Given the qualitative nature of the study, a large sample size was not required. A total of 20 in-depth interviews, 06 case studies & 03 life histories were conducted. Results and Discussion Relationship between Occupation and Household Income The correlation analysis revealed a significant relationship between the two variables in the socio-economic survey: occupation and household income, as shown in Table 1. Socio- economic status has been linked to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). Specifically, women from lower socio-economic backgrounds were found at a higher risk of developing PCOS, which is often exacerbated by financial stress. Additionally, women who experienced low socio-economic status during childhood were also at increased risk (Azziz, 2011).

In addition, it is recognizedthatIRplaysamajorroleinthepathophysiologyofallofthemetabolicdiseases, cardiovasculardisease,someneurodegenerativediseases,andselectedcancers[22,157].

IRresultsfromalterationsto cellularmembraneinsulin-receptorfunctionorintracellularsignaling,enzyme,metabolic orgenefunction[146,160,161]. Insulin resistance can be caused by a wide variety of mechanisms that have the ability to disrupt any part of this metabolic signaling system [53,161]. These include autoantibodies, receptor agonists and antagonists, hormones, inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, nutrient sensors and metabolic intermediates [160–163].

        "text": "Formulation of recommendations using the GRADE evidence to decision framework The Evidence to Decision (EtD) framework was used to document the judgments and decisions using the GRADE method for development of evidence-based recommendations. The framework prompts transparent documentation and discussion of decisions through assessment of the evidence, clinical expertise and patient preference for factors including: ● desirable and undesirable effects of the intervention; ● certainty of the evidence; ● values associated with the recommended intervention; ● balance of effects; ● resource requirements; ● cost-effectiveness; ● equity; acceptability; ● feasibility; ● subgroup considerations; ● implementation considerations; ● monitoring and evaluation; and ● research priorities. Using the framework, each of the evidence-based and consensus recommendations are given an overall grading of conditional or strong [15]. Clinical practice points have also been included, where important issues (such as safety, side effects or risks) arose from discussion of evidence-based or clinical consensus recommendations.

        "text": "Conflict of interest and confidentiality Conflict of interest has been proactively managed throughout the guideline development process as outlined in NHMRC Procedures and requirements for meeting the 2011 NHMRC standard for clinical practice guidelines [603]. All members of the GDGs have provided signed declarations of interest and a confidentiality agreement. Additionally, declarations of interest were a standing agenda item at each monthly meeting and GDG members were requested to detail areas for potential conflict. The process for managing conflict of interest and confidentiality and recorded declarations can be provided on request (MCHRI-PCOS-Guideline-Group-l@monash.edu). Training of GDGs in evidence review and guideline development methods All GDG members attended a workshop, where the methods of reviewing evidence and guideline development were described in detail. The purpose of this workshop was to familiarise the chairs and GDG members with: ● the process of guideline development overall ● the process of identifying, appraising and synthesising evidence in a format to facilitate the formulation of evidence-based recommendations ● grading the strength of evidence and its suitability to support evidence-based recommendations ● when to facilitate discussion and clinical judgement to formulate clinical consensus recommendations in the absence of evidence. Clinical question development and prioritisation An International survey and Delphi exercise was conducted to develop and prioritise clinical questions to be addressed. A further prioritisation exercise was conducted within the topic specific GDGs and consumer advisory groups to rank the importance of clinical questions to guide the evidence team and to reach consensus on which clinical questions were to be addressed by a systematic review or by narrative review. Systematic reviews were performed for highly prioritised questions and for those areas of greatest controversy. Narrative evidence reviews were completed a) where recent or concurrent systematic reviews were being completed by GDG members that could be captured on narrative review; b) where questions were less well suited to a PICO systematic review format; c) for lower prioritised questions or d) where there was insufficient evidence identified for a question where a systematic review was conducted. Forty questions were addressed by guideline systematic reviews, many others by systematic reviews captured in the narrative reviews and some by narrative reviews of isolated PCOS studies supported by systematic reviews/guidelines in the general population. 126 CONTENTS",
