    "generated_answer": "The Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder characterized by multiple cysts in the ovaries, elevated levels of androgens, and insulin resistance. It affects approximately 1% of women worldwide and is more common in women of African descent. The exact cause",
    "reference_answer": "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal and metabolic disorder that affects women of reproductive age and is diagnosed using the Rotterdam Criteria (2003), which require the presence of at least two out of the following three features: hyperandrogenism (or clinical signs such as hirsutism and androgenic alopecia), ovulatory dysfunction (irregular or absent menstruation), and polycystic ovaries seen on ultrasound (with at least 12 follicles or ovary volume >10 cm³). PCOS is associated with a range of systemic manifestations including insulin resistance, obesity, and increased risk of type 2 diabetes, indicating that ovarian dysfunction is often a consequence of broader metabolic disturbances.",

There is little disagreement that PCOS 65 should be considered a syndrome, that is, a collection of signs and features, where no single 66 test is diagnostic. In essence, the whole (or global assessment) is greater than the sum of the 67 individual features. However, establishing a clear, contemporaneous, and evidence-based 68 definition for this syndrome has important clinical and investigational implications. Nonetheless, 69 the definition of PCOS has continued to generate significant controversy (2-4). 70 Clinically, diagnosing a woman as having PCOS implies an increased risk for infertility, 71 dysfunctional bleeding, endometrial carcinoma, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), 72 dyslipidemia, hypertension, and possibly cardiovascular disease (CVD) . Furthermore, it has 73 important familial implications, principally, but not exclusively, for her sisters and daughters (6- 74 8). Finally, a diagnosis of PCOS may mandate life-long treatments (e.g. the use of insulin 75 sensitizers) and may negatively affect her ability to access healthcare coverage, principally in 76 capitalistic markets. Consequently, the diagnosis of PCOS should not be assigned lightly, and 77 diagnostic criteria should be based on robust data. 78 A judicious definition of PCOS is also essential to guide current and future research. The 79 inclusion of patients whose definition, characterization, and selection criteria are unclear 80 continues to plague the PCOS scientific literature. This issue is becoming critical as the field 81 moves to the establishment of larger clinical trials, and to studies of the molecular biology and 82 genetic nature of the disorder. In addition, definitions not based on clear-cut evidence have the 83 potential effect of discouraging future and needed research into the nature of the disorder, its 84 breadth and its phenotype. Consequently, a contemporaneous definition based on what is 85 currently known will benefit future investigation in this area. 86 The Androgen Excess Society (AES) is an international organization dedicated to promoting 87 knowledge, and original clinical and basic research, in every aspect of androgen excess 88 disorders, such as the polycystic ovary syndrome, non-classic adrenal hyperplasia, idiopathic",

Women with PCOS may present with menstrual irregularities, subfertility, obesity, and dermatological manifestations like hirsutism and acne. The long-term sequelae of the disorder include metabolic disorders, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disorders. Due to chronic anovulation and the unopposed effect of estrogen on the uterus, these women are at higher risk of developing endometrial cancer later in life. Adolescent women with PCOS may suffer from various psychological issues like depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and body image disorders which significantly affect their quality of life. The exact etiology of the disorder is not known however oxidative stress, genetic predisposition, and certain gene polymorphisms are thought to be the culprit for PCOS [10-14]. Various environmental factors, sedentary lifestyles, and unhealthy eating habits are also seen to be related. Rotterdam criteria, National Institute of Health (NIH), and androgen excess-PCOS Society criteria are used to diagnose the disorder. The management is usually targeted to treat the symptoms and prevent long-term sequelae.

    "question": "What is the connection between insulin resistance and PCOS?",
    "generated_answer": "The connection between insulin resistance and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is similar to that observed in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Insulin resistance is associated with an increased prevalence of obesity, and women with upper, rather than lower, body obesity have an increased frequency of hyperandrogenism. In PCOS, muscle mass is increased, and potential androgen-mediated changes in lean body mass must also be controlled for in order to explain the association of insulin resistance and PCOS. Studies in which body composition, assessed by hydrostatic weighing, has been matched to normal control women, and in which lean PCOS women, who had body composition and waist to hip girth ratios similar to controls, were studied, have confirmed that PCOS women are insulin resistant, independent of those potentially confounding parameters. Hyperandrogenism is implicated in insulin resistance in PCOS, and studies in cultured cells have confirmed the impression from these in vivo studies that an intrinsic defect in insulin action is present in PCOS. However, studies in PCOS have shown that obesity and PCOS are not synonymous, and that the ED value of insulin for suppression of hepatic glucose production is significantly increased only in obese PCOS women. This synergistic negative effect of obesity and PCOS on hepatic glucose production is an important factor in the pathogenesis of glucose intolerance. Sequential multiple-insulin-dose euglycemic clamp studies have indicated that the ED insulin for glucose uptake is significantly increased, and that maximal rates of glucose disposal are significantly decreased in lean and in obese PCOS women. It appears that body fat has a more pronounced negative effect on insulin sensitivity in women with PCOS, although adipocytes have failed to confirm earlier reports in blood cells of decreases in insulin receptor number and/or receptor affinity in PCOS.",
    "reference_answer": "Insulin resistance plays a central role in the pathophysiology of PCOS by disrupting glucose metabolism, increasing androgen production, and contributing to fat accumulation, particularly in visceral areas. Women with PCOS frequently exhibit reduced insulin sensitivity, which notSonly exacerbates metabolic symptoms such as obesity and dyslipidemia but also increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. This metabolic dysfunction is closely linked to menstrual irregularities, anovulation, and infertility, making insulin resistance a core target in PCOS management through dietary, pharmacological, and lifestyle interventions.",

    "generated_answer": "A low glycaemic index (GI) diet often recommended for PCOS is a high protein, moderate carbohydrate, moderate fat diet.",
    "reference_answer": "A low glycaemic index (GI) diet is recommended for women with PCOS because it reduces postprandial blood glucose spikes and insulin demand, which helps to manage insulin resistance—a central feature of PCOS. The study showed that such a diet, rich in whole grains, vegetables, legumes, and lean proteins, led to improved metabolic and hormonal profiles. Additionally, it was effective in increasing the dietary intake and bioavailability of essential water-soluble vitamins that are often deficient in PCOS.",

    "question": "What is the role of Metformin in managing PCOS?",
    "generated_answer": "The role of Metformin in managing PCOS is discussed in the context of the CONTEXT above. Metformin is a low cost, readily available medication that has been extensively used as an insulin sensitizer for over seven decades in DM2 and for several decades in PCOS. Insulin resistance is documented on clamp studies in 75% of lean women and 95% of overweight women, and addressing this has underpinned the use of metformin in PCOS. Metformin is currently widely used by women with PCOS, yet there is variability in recommendations across health professional specialties, with endocrinologists familiar with metformin and more likely to prescribe this therapy. Also the efficacy of metformin in terms of improving clinical outcomes remains uncertain. Mild side effects do cause some concern, and metformin use in PCOS is generally off label. However, metformin is a low cost, readily available medication and off label use in PCOS is allowed in many countries. A multitude of studies have been completed in PCOS for a range of clinical outcomes and synthesis of the literature and recommendations on metformin use was prioritized. Summary of systematic review evidence Metformin versus placebo Twenty RCTs that address outcomes for this comparison were identified [318, 319, 418-435], of which 19 RCTs were in adults [318, 418-435], and 1 was in adolescents . Weight: When 5 RCTs were combined in meta-analysis, there was no statistically significant difference between metformin and placebo .

The study indicates that despite dietary improvements, levels of certain vitamins such as B1 (thiamine), B3 (niacin), and folate remained suboptimal, suggesting the need for targeted supplementation. Forms such as benfotiamine (for B1), niacinamide (for B3), and L-methylfolate (for B9) offer better bioavailability and efficacy.

    "generated_answer": "Inositol supplements can be helpful for PCOS symptoms, but they should not be used alone. They may improve insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammation, but they do not address the underlying causes of PCOS. Inositol supplements may also interfere with other medications used to treat PCOS, such as antidepressants and antihypertensives. Therefore, it's essential to discuss the potential benefits and risks of inositol supplements with your healthcare provider before starting any new treatment regimen.",
    "reference_answer": "Yes, inositol, particularly myo-inositol, is an effective treatment for PCOS. The study confirmed that inositol improves insulin sensitivity, restores ovulatory function, and regulates the menstrual cycle. It also reduces the risk of cardiovascular complications and does so without the gastrointestinal side effects associated with metformin. When combined with folate, inositol has shown even greater benefits in metabolic and reproductive outcomes.",

Should women with PCOS, and with or without infertility, undergo pre -conception (pre-pregnancy) evaluation (assessment) for (and where possible correction of) risk factors that may lead to adverse (early or late) pregnancy outcomes? Should women with PCOS undergo close (early or late) pregnancy monitoring for adverse pregnancy outcomes? Clinical need for the questions Ovulatory disturbance is a key diagnostic feature of PCOS, leading to infertility, and women with PCOS also have adverse pregnancy outcomes. Modifiable lifestyle factors, especially excess weight, exacerbate infertility, response to infertility treatment and pregnancy health and prevention of weight gain and where needed lifestyle intervention for weight loss is recommended (Chapter 3). The prevalence of miscarriage appears increased in PCOS with more research needed. Whilst there is clear recognition of the need to optimise preconception and pregnancy health in the general population, there is currently no evidence-based guideline in these areas in high-risk women with PCOS. Summary of narrative evidence A systematic review was not conducted to answer this question, which was reviewed narratively based on clinical expertise. Modifiable risk factors known to impact fertility and response to Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART): BMI < 18 or > 25kg/m2, waist to hip ratio (WHR – central adiposity), smoking status, alcohol consumption, prescribed and recreational drug use, untreated sexually transmitted infections, nutritional status, supplementation with folate, vitamin D and dental health have been identified as modifiable risk factors preconception . Anxiety, depression and psychological symptoms can impact relationship health, sexual intimacy and ART treatment adherence , whilst mental health care supports treatment adherence, relationship health and quality of life (QoL). These factors should be optimised, aligned with WHO guidance, and priority areas and recommendations for the general population . Pregnancy and fertility complications: Women with PCOS are at an increased risk of gestational diabetes (GDM), preterm birth, pre-eclampsia, miscarriage, still birth, longer time to conception and poor embryo development, reduced embryo implantation rates, ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome (OHSS)  and ectopic pregnancy , which are also exacerbated by obesity.

    "question": "How does myo-inositol help with fertility in PCOS?",
    "generated_answer": "Myo-inositol helps with fertility in PCOS by improving insulin sensitivity, which can lead to better glucose control and improved ovulation. It also helps to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, which can improve fertility outcomes. Additionally, myo-inositol may have anti-inflammatory effects that could help reduce symptoms of PCOS such as acne and hair loss. However, more research is needed to fully understand the potential benefits and risks of myo-inositol in PCOS.",
    "reference_answer": "Myo-inositol is emerging as an effective and well-tolerated alternative to metformin in the treatment of PCOS. It improves insulin sensitivity, restores ovulation, and helps regulate the menstrual cycle without the gastrointestinal side effects often associated with metformin. When combined with folate, myo-inositol also supports homocysteine regulation and improves reproductive and metabolic outcomes. Its use has shown significant promise in clinical studies, making it a preferred supplement for women seeking natural management options for PCOS.",

Living in a society with such disease like PCOS may depress the self-consciousness and lower self-stem of patient. ‘The cultural perception about the women role in a society is highly valued. As the reproductive inability, of women or infertility due to PCOS lead to feeling inadequacy and failure in society in which motherhood is highly valued (Dewailly et al., 2010). A PCOS patient also faces social stigma that had a great effect on the personality of patient in socio- cultural perspective. ‘Some symptoms of PCOS like infertility, obesity, unwanted hair growth causes social stigma in patients and causes anxiety, depression, and a negative image of body (Cooney et al., 2017). This all impart a negative effect between socio-cultural factors such family relationships, work, employment, and the patient (Hudson, 2008; Joham et al., 2022; Kaur et al., 2021). Socio- cultural factors, combined with socio-economic status, significantly impact individuals' lives. For example, a PCOS patient with a low socio-economic status may be unable to afford treatments for symptoms such as hirsutism, obesity, and infertility. These symptoms, exacerbated by social stigmas and cultural norms, can lead to body image issues and diminished self-esteem. Consequently, these factors indirectly affect women's ability to pursue higher education, secure high-paying jobs, and access other career opportunities (Di Fede et al., 2009). When managing a chronic disease, patients strive to improve their lifestyle and live contentedly with their condition. To achieve this, they employ various coping mechanisms to address social stigmas, cultural norms, and other social and medical challenges. These coping strategies include maintaining a healthy diet (Shahid et al., 2022), engaging in regular exercise and physical activities, practicing stress-relief meditation, minimizing unnecessary obligations, fostering positive social connections, seeking peer support, and avoiding negative coping methods such as alcohol and substance use (Wilder & Pype, 2021). The symptoms of PCOS are conspicuous and often conflict with societal cultural norms for women. Exploring the socio-cultural perspective on the personality of individuals living with PCOS involves understanding the intricate interplay between cultural norms, societal expectations, and individual experiences (Pathak & Nichter, 2015). In various cultural contexts, femininity and womanhood are frequently associated with fertility, physical appearance, and overall health. For women with PCOS, symptoms such as irregular menstruation, hirsutism, and infertility can challenge these traditional ideals of femininity, potentially impacting their self-concept and social identity (Becker & Nachtigal, 2019). These socio-cultural factors have contributed to the formation of social stigmas surrounding PCOS. The stigma associated with PCOS related symptoms, such as weight gain and acne, can lead to feelings of shame and social isolation, adversely affecting the psychosocial well-being of affected individuals. Additionally, cultural beliefs and gendered expectations shape the experiences of women with PCOS, influencing their self-esteem, body image, and interpersonal relationships (Simbar, 2014). Within the context of socio-cultural factors, socio-economic status also influences the lives of PCOS patients.",

        "text": "2.4 Body image In women with PCOS, what is the prevalence and severity of body image distress and should they be screened? In women with PCOS, what is the most effective tool/method to assess body image distress? Clinical need for the questions Body image is complex and is influenced by many factors. Body image is defined here as the way a woman may feel, think about and view their body including their appearance. Relevant physical (excess weight and hirsutism), psychological (self-esteem) and sociocultural factors influence body image. Assessment of body image considers body dissatisfaction, disordered eating, body size estimation and weight. Most women from the general population are dissatisfied with their body, yet negative body image appears more prevalent in PCOS and impacts on thoughts and feelings of health, appearance, QoL, mood and physical fitness. In this context, body image should be considered in PCOS. Recommendations for screening and assessment that are easy to use and widely applicable are needed and if identified, addressing negative body and associated mood disorders is important to improve emotional wellbeing and QoL in PCOS. Summary of narrative review evidence A systematic review was not conducted to answer these questions; therefore, the literature was reviewed narratively based on clinical expertise. Women with PCOS, compared with controls, had a negative body image on the validated Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire (MBSRQ) . Evidence is conflicting however, with some case- control studies not finding differences in body image satisfaction and self-esteem compared to women without PCOS . Women with PCOS feel less physically attractive, healthy or physically fit and are less satisfied with their body size and appearance , and this negative body image predicts both depression and anxiety . Infertile women with PCOS have lower body satisfaction than non-infertile women with PCOS . Hirsute women experienced lower self-esteem than non-hirsute women . Overall, PCOS features, in particular hirsutism and increased weight, impact negatively on body image and QoL , and negative body image is strongly associated with depression in women with PCOS , even after controlling for weight . We did not identify any evidence in women with PCOS to address the question on screening tools and therefore, a clinical consensus recommendation has been made based on the expertise of the multidisciplinary GDG and key relevant sources of evidence-based information for the general population. Assessment of body image includes measures of body dissatisfaction and disordered eating , body size estimation  and weight . The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Guideline 31 – Obsessive Compulsive Disorder: Core interventions in the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder and body dysmorphic disorder  and the Australian Medical Association Position Statement: Body Image and Health 2002  informed the recommendations provided.

        "text": "2.2 Depressive and anxiety symptoms, screening and treatment In women with PCOS, what is the prevalence and severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms and should they be screened? In women with PCOS, what is the most effective tool/method to assess depression and/or anxiety? Clinical need for the questions The prevalence and severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms are increased in PCOS. Psychological conditions impact on QoL and are likely to influence engagement in lifestyle interventions and self-management in PCOS. Hormonal medications can influence mood in the general population, although literature in PCOS is limited . Effective, readily available screening tools are available for clinical practice, yet uptake and recognition of psychological symptoms in PCOS appears limited internationally. A large international survey has shown that most women report psychological issues are under-recognised  and less than 5% are satisfied with emotional support and counselling. Given the prevalence and severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms and the dissatisfaction expressed by women in this area, these clinical questions were prioritised. Summary of systematic review evidence A systematic review was not completed for the first question and the review for the second question did not identify any evidence in women with PCOS to answer this question. Summary of narrative review evidence These areas were reviewed narratively, based on clinical expertise. Depression: Depressive symptoms and depression are more common in PCOS , with daily fatigue, sleep disturbances and diminished interest prominent . A meta-analysis of 10 studies reported increased depressive symptom scores in 44% with PCOS versus 17% in controls (OR: 4.03, 95% CI: 2.96-5.5, p<0.01) , which persisted in BMI matched studies. A meta-analysis of 910 women with PCOS and 1347 controls reported higher depression scores in PCOS , although these may not have been clinically significant. A meta-analysis of 26 studies including 4716 participants from 14 countries , noted scores were not in a clinically significant range in half of studies, and others were consistent with mild depression. A recent meta-analysis of 23 studies with rigorous inclusion criteria including physician diagnosis of PCOS , showed increased moderate/severe depressive symptoms (OR4.18, 95% CI: 2.68-6.52) with a prevalence of depression of 36.6% in PCOS (IQR: 22.3, 50.0%) and 14.2% in controls (IQR: 10.7, 22.2%), independent of obesity and seen in both clinic and community recruits. Limitations included relatively small sample sizes and limited formal diagnosis of depression on clinical assessment. Also, a large population-based registry study  showing an increased adjusted risk of depression in PCOS and a large hospital database study documented depression in PCOS (9.8%), compared to those without a recorded diagnosis of PCOS (4.6%) . Overall, women with PCOS have a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms and depression, independent of obesity. CONTENTS",

        "text": "Anxiety: Anxiety symptoms are increased in PCOS . Meta-analyses of six studies and another of eleven studies reported higher anxiety scores in PCOS compared to controls . Another of four studies reported a sevenfold increase in abnormal anxiety scores in PCOS , however, heterogeneity existed in all meta-analysis. A recent rigorous meta-analysis of ten studies  showed increased moderate/severe anxiety symptoms in PCOS (OR: 5.38; 95% CI: 2.28, 12.67), with a prevalence of 41.9% (IQR: 13.6, 52.0%) in PCOS and 8.5% (IQR: 3.3, 12.0%) in controls. A large population-based study of 24385 women with PCOS matched for sex, age and country of birth to ten controls, showed increased anxiety disorder (OR 1.37, CI: 1.32, 1.43) . A large hospital database showed anxiety in PCOS at 14%, compared to 5.9% of those without a diagnosis of PCOS . Collectively, these studies indicate increased anxiety symptoms and anxiety disorders in women with PCOS, across diverse ethnic groups. The cause of depressive and anxiety symptoms in PCOS are not fully elucidated  as are the effects of PCOS treatments. While acne, hirsutism, infertility and increased BMI have been linked to increased mood and distress, the evidence is inconsistent [205-208]. Further potential contributors to depression and anxiety in PCOS include the chronic [209-213], complex and frustrating nature of PCOS . Chronic conditions can cause related emotional distress, and treatment of the underlying condition may improve these, although few PCOS studies have explored this. In PCOS, consideration should be given to the individual underlying concerns for each woman to optimise impact on emotional wellbeing. Screening for depressive and anxiety symptoms: Given the lack of evidence to address this question in PCOS on systematic review, key relevant sources of evidence-based information were sourced for the general population, and with multidisciplinary GDG expertise and consumer perspectives, informed the recommendations. These included: ● The treatment of depression in adults with chronic physical health problems, NICE, 2009 . ● Common mental health problems: identification and pathways to care, NICE, 2011 . ● Antenatal and postnatal mental health: clinical management and service guidance, NICE, 2014 . ● Screening for Depression in Adults: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendations, 2016 . ● Screening for Depression in Children and Adolescents: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendations 2016 . ● Screening for and Treatment of Suicide Risk Relevant to Primary Care: A Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force, 2014 . ● Royal Australian NZ College of Psychiatrists Clinical Practice Guidelines for Mood Disorders 2015 . ● Principles of Practice in Mental Health Assessment with Aboriginal Australians. In Working Together: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mental health and wellbeing principles and practice, 2014 . National US and UK guidelines recommend routine screening for common mental health disorders for all adults and adolescents, particularly with chronic physical health problems and in the perinatal period [216-220]. US guidelines conclude moderate benefit of depression screening in the general adult population .",

In women with PCOS, does obesity impact on prevalence and severity of hormonal and clinical features? Clinical need for the questions Obesity affects the majority of women recruited from clinic populations and is common in community-based studies. The complex pathophysiology and clinical heterogeneity of PCOS has contributed to the lack of a clear understanding of interactions between PCOS, excess body weight and body fat distribution. Obesity, particularly central obesity, increases insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism, may increase PCOS prevalence and exacerbates the clinical features of PCOS. It is also of significant concern to women with PCOS and a key target for prevention and management in this condition. The degree of increased risk of excess weight and the impact on prevalence and severity of features of PCOS remain unclear. Summary of narrative review evidence A systematic review was not conducted to answer these questions, which were reviewed narratively based on clinical expertise. This review informs both the recommendations for assessment and screening in chapter 1 and the recommendations in chapter 3. In terms of prevalence of excess weight in PCOS, the great majority of women seeking treatment for PCOS are overweight or obese . Rates of weight gain appear higher in PCOS, and BMI increases of one, are associated with a 9% higher prevalence of PCOS . Women with PCOS also appear to have higher genetic susceptibility to obesity . The temporal trends of obesity prevalence in PCOS show an increase from 51% in the 90s to 74% in the following decades . There is general recognition that women with PCOS who present for diagnosis and care may be more likely to have excess weight than those who do not, however longitudinal community-based data supports higher weight gain and excess body weight in PCOS. Weight gain over 10 years among women with PCOS is significantly greater than in unaffected women in a longitudinal community-based study (mean difference 2.6kg 95% CI 1.2-4.0) . Weight gain escalates from adolescence and early vigilance and intervention is important. Central obesity increases over time with a progressive increase in waist hip ratio between 20 - 25 years and 40 - 45 years . This is consistent with reports from a prospective birth cohort of increased weight gain in early adulthood in women with symptoms of or a diagnosis of PCOS compared with controls . Overall rates of weight gain and excess weight are increased in PCOS. Obesity influences the phenotypic expression of PCOS, exacerbating metabolic, reproductive, and psychological features . Lipid abnormalities are increased independently in PCOS and are exacerbated by excess weight . Central obesity is associated with more severe metabolic disturbance . The prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and DM2 is further increased in women with PCOS with excess weight, especially in high-risk ethnic groups . Conversely, weight loss reduces abdominal fat and insulin resistance and improves clinical features of PCOS (see Chapter 3) . CONTENTS",

        "text": "4.1 Pharmacological treatment principles in PCOS In reviewing the literature on pharmacological treatments, general principles emerged that apply across all pharmacological therapies. These have been extracted into a set of clinical practice points to inform women and guide health professionals when considering or recommending pharmacological therapy in PCOS. These practice points apply to all pharmacological treatments prioritised and addressed in the guideline. Recommendations 4.1.1 CPP Consideration of the individual’s personal characteristics, preferences and values is important in recommending pharmacological treatment. 4.1.2 CPP When prescribing pharmacological therapy in PCOS, benefits, adverse effects and contraindications in PCOS and general populations need to be considered and discussed before commencement. 4.1.3 CPP COCPs, metformin and other pharmacological treatments are generally off label# in PCOS. However off label use is predominantly evidence-based and is allowed in many countries. Where is it allowed, health professionals need to inform women and discuss the evidence, possible concerns and side effects of treatment. 4.1.4 CPP Holistic approaches are required and pharmacological therapy in PCOS needs to be considered alongside education, lifestyle and other options including cosmetic therapy and counselling. ‘Off label’ prescribing occurs when a drug is prescribed for an indication, a route of administration, or a patient group that is not included in the approved product information document for that drug by the relevant regulatory body. Prescribing off label is often unavoidable and common and does not mean that the regulatory body has rejected the indication; more commonly there has not been a submission to request evaluation of the indication or that patient group for any given drug.

        "text": "1.7 Menopause life-stage What is the post-menopausal phenotype of PCOS and how elevated should androgens be to indicate PCOS? Clinical need for the question Menopause is a natural life stage occurring generally around the age of 51 years. The diagnosis of PCOS by Rotterdam criteria requires two of three criteria in women, including oligo- and/or anovulation, clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries by ultrasound . However, these three criteria for diagnosis change naturally with age impacting on phenotype and presenting challenges in diagnosis. Overall it is acknowledged that there is inadequate evidence of the natural history of PCOS and the concept of whether PCOS resolves and/ or persists remains unclear pending better longitudinal studies. Postmenopausal phenotypes of PCOS are poorly defined, with limited longitudinal natural history studies. Uncertainty in assessment and diagnosis at this life stage leads to confusion for health professionals and women on long term health risks and screening recommendations. Summary of narrative review evidence A systematic review was not conducted to answer this question, which was reviewed narratively based on clinical expertise. With aging, changes occur in all three diagnostic criteria. Menstrual cycles become more regular in PCOS [110-112]. Ovarian volume and follicle number decrease longitudinally in PCOS and control women. Using cross-sectional data, ovarian volume and follicle number decrease in both groups, but the decrease in ovarian volume is less pronounced in women with PCOS than in controls. Age-based criteria to define PCOM have been proposed using a combination of age, log ovarian volume, follicle number, and testosterone to distinguish PCOS from non-PCOS . Androgens decline with age in women generally including those with PCOS [113-115] in longitudinal and cross-sectional studies . Testosterone free androgen index (FAI), and calculated free testosterone are higher in women with PCOS aged 18–44 years compared to controls . Regarding menstrual cycles, the average age of menopause in PCOS is not known. A two-year delay in the age of menopause has been estimated using AMH levels  and PCOS has been independently associated with later menopause . There is no established phenotype for PCOS after menopause. In postmenopausal women, ovulation ceases. Hirsutism is greater in PCOS than in controls in postmenopausal women  but little is known about acne and alopecia in these women. Postmenopausal women with PCOS have higher 17-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, DHEAS, total Testosterone and FAI than women without PCOS . However, androgen assays are unreliable in women especially with the lower levels generally observed postmenopause . Postmenopausal women with PCOS have abnormal glucose metabolism  and higher triglycerides than controls . Other methods to identify PCOS in postmenopausal women have been proposed. For PCOS diagnosis in menopause, previous history of oligo-ovulation, PCOM and current features of hyperandrogenism  have been considered, as have insulin resistance . Recommendations 1.7.1 CCR Postmenopausal persistence of PCOS could be considered likely with continuing evidence of hyperandrogenism.",

Clinical need for the question Ovulation induction therapies are first and second line in infertility management in women with PCOS, anovulation and no other fertility factors. Yet resistance to and failure of ovulation induction therapies and inability to overcome other concomitant causes of infertility means that Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) therapies including In-vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) used in male factor infertility, have a role in PCOS. IVF has risks and limitations, yet also offers the opportunity for pregnancy and live birth. Challenges exist across the diversity of protocols available for IVF and concerns in PCOS including OHSS, high oestradiol levels, accelerated endometrial maturation and optimally the use of “freeze all” interventions. The clinical practice questions here include indications, timing and comparative efficacy with other treatments, yet RCTs in this area are very limited in women with anovulatory PCOS. Summary of systematic review evidence We did not identify any evidence in women with PCOS to answer the question and therefore the literature has been reviewed narratively. Summary of narrative review evidence There are no RCTs identified by the guideline development team, comparing stimulated IVF ± ICSI therapy with ovulation induction in women diagnosed with PCOS. The role of IVF in PCOS was explored by the WHO guidance group, and the review and recommendations were considered here by the GDG in making their recommendations . Factors that influenced considerations here include access, cost and risks. The patient and societal benefits of ovulation induction compared with IVF treatments in anovulatory PCOS women require RCTs and systematic analysis. Outcomes as time to conception, cost of therapy, QoL, OHSS risk, multiple pregnancy, miscarriage and livebirth rates should be investigated. Recommendations 5.9.1 CCR In the absence of an absolute indication for IVF ± ICSI, women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility could be offered IVF as third line therapy where first or second line ovulation induction therapies have failed. 5.9.2 CPP In women with anovulatory PCOS, the use of IVF is effective and when elective single embryo transfer is used, multiple pregnancies can be minimised. 5.9.3 CPP Women with PCOS undergoing IVF ± ICSI therapy need to be counselled prior to starting treatment including on: ● availability, cost and convenience ● increased risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ● options to reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation. Justification The GDG deemed IVF should be considered after failed ovulation induction treatment with high pregnancy rates per cycle, especially in younger women. Given the risks and the high costs that can be prohibitive for many patients, IVF should be considered third line medical therapy. It was noted that conception and delivery are highly valued by health professionals and women with PCOS and even when cost and risks are increased, many may elect to undertake IVF. Health Professionals must weigh benefits and risk when advising PCOS patients to enable an informed decision.",

Clinically evident menstrual dysfunction, such as oligo-amenorrhea or abnormal uterine 171 bleeding, can be observed in a majority of patients with PCOS. 173 a) Ovulatory and menstrual dysfunction: In large series of patients diagnosed with 174 PCOS, approximately 75% have clinically evident menstrual dysfunction (23-37) (Table 1). 175 Current data also suggests that ~20% of women with PCOS will present with a history of 176 apparent eumenorrhea (i.e. subclinical oligo-anovulation) (23, 25-39) (Table 1). In clinical 177 practice, the presence of anovulation in clinically hyperandrogenic (i.e. hirsute) eumenorrheic 178 women may be determined by measuring a serum progesterone level sometime during days 20 179 through 24 of the cycle. If anovulation is present, it may be prudent to confirm this finding with a 180 repeat study. 182 b) Hyperandrogenemia: Elevated circulating androgen levels are observed in 183 approximately 60-80% of PCOS patients(Table 2) (35-37, 40-42). The vast majority of the 184 abnormal values are in the form of free testosterone (T), with the sole measurement of total T 185 adding a limited amount to the diagnosis . 186 The value of also measuring androstenedione is unclear, but it may increase the number of 187 subjects identified as hyperandrogenemic by ~10% . Approximately 25% of patients with 188 PCOS will demonstrate supranormal levels of the androgen metabolite DHEAS  which may 189 be the sole abnormality in circulating androgens in ~10% of these patients . 190 Alternatively, measuring the level of DHEA, a weak androgen primarily of adrenal origin, has 191 limited diagnostic value.",

        "text": "1.4 Ultrasound and polycystic ovarian morphology When is ultrasound indicated to diagnose PCOS? What are the most effective ultrasound criteria to diagnose PCOS? Clinical need for the questions Polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) was incorporated into the diagnosis of PCOS in 2003 in the Rotterdam criteria, as a common feature associated with clinical and endocrine features of the condition . This introduced arguably milder phenotypes into PCOS with limited data on natural history, prompting calls for phenotype identification and more research . The definition of PCOM in the Rotterdam criteria is 12 or more follicles measuring 2 - 9mm throughout the entire ovary or an ovarian volume ≥ 10cm3. This was based on a single report on sensitivity and specificity in PCOS compared to controls. Factors that mandate revision of this diagnostic criteria include inadequate initial evidence, advances in ultrasound technology with greater resolution, variable operator skill level, lack of standard reporting, ill-defined cut-offs between normal ovaries and PCOM, the impact of approach (e.g. transvaginal), body habits and age. Natural changes occur in antral follicle count during the pubertal and menopausal transitions and up to 70% of adolescents have PCOM on original criteria . The term “cystic” is a misnomer referring to arrested follicles (not cysts) and identification of PCOM alone can lead to over diagnosis. Diagnosis of PCOS mandates not only PCOM, but associated features of hyperandrogenism and/or ovulatory dysfunction. Independent of diagnosis, if clinically indicated, ultrasound is useful to screen for other pathology. This clinical question was prioritised, with recognition that a reproducible technique and standard reporting to reliably estimate follicle number per ovary and define PCOM, is critical in the accurate diagnosis of PCOS. Summary of systematic review evidence A systematic review was completed to address the second clinical question on the most effective ultrasound criteria to diagnose PCOS. Fifteen studies of moderate to high risk of bias, reported the diagnostic accuracy of different ovarian morphology parameters to detect PCOS [32, 37, 59-71]. Two of the fifteen studies were in adolescents . The index tests addressed in these studies included various measures and thresholds of ovarian volume and follicle number. None of the studies pre-specified thresholds. Some studies have reported diagnostic accuracy data using multiple thresholds. Due to the heterogeneity in threshold/cut off values for each index test, meta-analyses (for pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates) could not be performed. However, forest plots were created and imputation of sensitivity and specificity data performed to derive true and false positives and true and false negatives to provide greater detail on accuracy outlined in the technical report. This approach enabled a rigorous evaluation of available evidence, acknowledging the overall poor quality of the studies. For follicle number per ovary (FNPO) there were 11 studies with 2961 adult participants suggesting optimal sensitivity and specificity at > 19 per ovary.",

Monitoring could be at each visit or at a minimum 6-12 monthly, with frequency planned and agreed between the health professional and the individual. Weight, height and ideally waist circumference should be measured and BMI calculated. ● BMI categories and waist circumference should follow World Health Organisation guidelines also noting ethnic and adolescent ranges. ● Consideration for Asian and high risk ethnic groups including monitoring waist circumference. All with PCOS should be assessed for individual cardiovascular risk factors and global CVD risk. If screening reveals CVD risk factors including obesity, cigarette smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance and lack of physical activity, women with PCOS should be considered at increased risk of CVD. Overweight and obese women with PCOS, regardless of age, should have a fasting lipid profile (total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride level at diagnosis). Thereafter, measurement should be guided by the results and the global CVD risk. All women with PCOS should have blood pressure measured annually. CVD risk in women with PCOS remains unclear pending high quality studies, however prevalence of CVD risk factors is increased, warranting awareness and consideration of screening. Gestational diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes Regardless of age, gestational diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes (5 fold in Asia, 4 fold in the Americas and 3 fold in Europe) are increased in PCOS, with risk independent of, yet exacerbated by obesity. Glycaemic status should be assessed at baseline in all with PCOS and thereafter, every one to three years, based on presence of other diabetes risk factors. In high risk women with PCOS (including a BMI > 25kg/m2 or in Asians > 23kg/m2, history of abnormal glucose tolerance or family history of diabetes, hypertension or high risk ethnicity) an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is recommended. Otherwise a fasting glucose or HbA1c should be performed. An OGTT should be offered in all with PCOS when planning pregnancy or seeking fertility treatment, given increased hyperglycaemia and comorbidities in pregnancy.",

    "question": "Why is benfotiamine preferred over regular thiamine in PCOS patients?",
    "generated_answer": "Thiamine (B1) is preferable over regular thiamine (B6) in PCOS patients due to its ability to support the development of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and prevent the adverse effects of hyperglycemia and oxidative stress. Thiamine deficiency is associated with diabetic neuropathy, which can lead to peripheral nerve damage. Metformin is commonly used to treat PCOS, but it may cause side effects such as insulin resistance and low folate levels. L-methylfolate is more bioavailable than folic acid and has higher absorption levels, making it a better supplement for PCOS patients. MI and folic acid have a positive effect on metabolic parameters, including insulin resistance and cardiovascular profile, while supplementation with 5mg of folic acid every day resulted in a reduction in Hcy intake in HOMA-B plasma and a decrease in concentration of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in blood compared to folic acid and placebo groups. Additionally, significant increases in TAC in the plasma and glutathione levels were observed in the thiamine group compared to folic acid and placebo groups.",

Strengths to our study include the large population of women with and without PCOS from a community-based population in contrast to the majority of the existing research assessing diet and PCOS. This minimises selection bias. This is also more likely to capture a lower proportion ofwomenwithPCOSwithamoresevereclinicalphenotypeandahigherBMIwhotypicallypresent to clinical services and are captured in research studies . While the use of self-report PCOS is a limitation,thenatureofthisresearchmeansthatitisnotfeasibletoclinicallyverifyPCOSorcontrol status. It is also not possible to determine the PCOS phenotype or which diagnostic criteria were usedindiagnosis. However,giventhattheRotterdamcriteriawerefirstpublishedin2004,itis also most likely that the majority of women self-reporting diagnosed PCOS in Survey 4, conducted in 2006, would have been diagnosed based on NIH criteria. There are also some other limitations to our study. We report here 58% participant retention compared to baseline levels 13 years prior which may indicate bias and limit generalisability. However, no differences between completors and non-completors has previously been reported indicating a likely minimal effect of attrition on outcomes . Although the FFQ is a validated measure of assessing nutritional intake, we are not able to assess the contribution of dietary patterns to the development or severity of PCOS due to the study design and report here only associations between dietary patterns and PCOS status. Further,thetotalvarianceexplainedbyeachfactorwasintermediatecomparedwithpreviousfactor analyses conducted in different age groups ; however, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of samplingadequacywas0.78,exceedingtherecommendedvalueof0.6;andBartlett'stestofSphericity achieved statistical significance indicating the correlations in the data set are appropriate for factor analysis. Moreover,thefoodgroupsloadingonthefactorswerevariedandmanyweregreaterthan the 0.25 cut-off value suggesting that our population had a varied diet that was, nevertheless, still specifictotheidentifiedfactors. Asthepresentstudyisthefirstofitskindinthispopulation,further studies are required to refute or support our findings and future work is warranted assessing the contributionofdietarypatternintaketotheseverityorincidenceofPCOS. 5. Conclusions In conclusion, we report for the first time the independent association of PCOS status with self-reported dietary patterns, specifically a Mediterranean diet pattern. This may indicate an improvement in the quality of dietary intake following a diagnosis of PCOS. We also report no increaseindietarypatternshighinnon-core,meatortake-awayfoodsdespiteahigherbodyweight. Combined with our prior research showing healthier intake but higher caloric consumption, it appears that women with PCOS may have a greater appetite and are more overweight, despite a healthier diet. Future research should examine the contribution of dietary patterns to the incidence and severity of PCOS and the potential for modification of dietary patterns in the lifestyle managementofPCOS.

Since muscle is the major site of insulin-mediated glucose use  and androgens can increase muscle mass , potential androgen-mediated changes in lean body (primarily muscle) mass must also be controlled for in PCOS . Studies in which body composition, assessed by the most precise available method (hydrostatic weighing), has been matched to normal control women, and in which lean PCOS women, who had body composition and waist to hip girth ratios similar to controls, were studied, have confirmed that PCOS women are insulin resistant, independent of those potentially confounding parameters . The impact of hyperandrogenism on insulin sensitivity is discussed below, but studies in cultured cells have confirmed the impression from these in vivo studies that an intrinsic defect in insulin action is present in PCOS . View larger version (22K): [in this window] [in a new window] pmol/liter ( 100 µU/ml) is decreased by 35–40% in PCOS women compared with age- and weight-matched control women. This decrease is similar in magnitude to Basal hepatic glucose production and the ED value of insulin for suppression of hepatic glucose production are significantly increased only in obese PCOS women  (Fig. 6 ). This synergistic negative effect of obesity and PCOS on hepatic glucose production is an important factor in the pathogenesis of glucose intolerance . This is analogous to NIDDM in general where defects in insulin action, presumably genetic, synergize with environmentally induced insulin resistance, primarily obesity- related, to produce glucose intolerance . Sequential multiple-insulin-dose euglycemic clamp studies have indicated that the ED insulin for glucose uptake is significantly increased, and that maximal rates of glucose disposal are significantly decreased in lean and in obese PCOS women  (Fig. 6 ). It appears, however, that body fat has a more pronounced negative effect on insulin sensitivity in women with PCOS .",

    "question": "How does niacinamide affect ovarian function in PCOS?",
    "generated_answer": "The OCP has long been used in PCOS to induce regular cycles, protect the endometrium and treat hyperandrogenism. Mechanisms of action include a significant first pass hepatic effect, increasing production of hepatic proteins including sex hormone binding globulin. This reduces free circulating androgen levels, even with low dose OCPs. This important mechanism of antiandrogenic action does not occur with progestin alone or non- oral oestrogen containing contraceptive preparations. The OCP also reduces ovarian androgen production. There has been concerning data that the OCP can increase insulin resistance and worsen glucose tolerance. Studies are inadequate and data conflicting with more research needed, however consideration should be given to the use of low dose OCPs in the management of PCOS.",

    "question": "What is the significance of SHBG in PCOS?",
    "generated_answer": "The significance of SHBG in PCOS is that it plays a role in regulating hormone levels in women with PCOS. It is believed that SHBG helps maintain normal levels of estrogen and progesterone, which are necessary for normal ovulation and menstruation. Without adequate SHBG levels, estrogen levels can become too high, leading to symptoms such as irregular periods, heavy menstrual bleeding, and weight gain. By reducing SHBG levels, hormonal imbalances caused by PCOS can be addressed, potentially improving overall health outcomes.",
    "reference_answer": "SHBG (sex hormone-binding globulin) binds androgens in circulation. In PCOS, low SHBG results in increased free androgens, contributing to symptoms like hirsutism, acne, and menstrual irregularities. High homocysteine is inversely correlated with SHBG levels.",

        "text": "AES PCOS Phenotype Task Force Report 8/23/2006 63 The disorder that eventually would be known as the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) was 64 initially described by Stein and Leventhal in 1935 . There is little disagreement that PCOS 65 should be considered a syndrome, that is, a collection of signs and features, where no single 66 test is diagnostic. In essence, the whole (or global assessment) is greater than the sum of the 67 individual features. However, establishing a clear, contemporaneous, and evidence-based 68 definition for this syndrome has important clinical and investigational implications. Nonetheless, 69 the definition of PCOS has continued to generate significant controversy (2-4). 70 Clinically, diagnosing a woman as having PCOS implies an increased risk for infertility, 71 dysfunctional bleeding, endometrial carcinoma, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), 72 dyslipidemia, hypertension, and possibly cardiovascular disease (CVD) . Furthermore, it has 73 important familial implications, principally, but not exclusively, for her sisters and daughters (6- 74 8). Finally, a diagnosis of PCOS may mandate life-long treatments (e.g. the use of insulin 75 sensitizers) and may negatively affect her ability to access healthcare coverage, principally in 76 capitalistic markets. Consequently, the diagnosis of PCOS should not be assigned lightly, and 77 diagnostic criteria should be based on robust data. 78 A judicious definition of PCOS is also essential to guide current and future research. The 79 inclusion of patients whose definition, characterization, and selection criteria are unclear 80 continues to plague the PCOS scientific literature. This issue is becoming critical as the field 81 moves to the establishment of larger clinical trials, and to studies of the molecular biology and 82 genetic nature of the disorder. In addition, definitions not based on clear-cut evidence have the 83 potential effect of discouraging future and needed research into the nature of the disorder, its 84 breadth and its phenotype. Consequently, a contemporaneous definition based on what is 85 currently known will benefit future investigation in this area. 86 The Androgen Excess Society (AES) is an international organization dedicated to promoting 87 knowledge, and original clinical and basic research, in every aspect of androgen excess 88 disorders, such as the polycystic ovary syndrome, non-classic adrenal hyperplasia, idiopathic",
